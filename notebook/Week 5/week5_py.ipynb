    "Datasets are not always accessible through databases, or on-disk CSVs, but rather through web-based APIs. This often means that a client can issue an [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) request to the API, and expect a response with the desired data in return. We'll take a look at an example of such an API and make some HTTP requests using a python package called `requests`."

Once an individual has suffered a TIA, preventative measures can be taken to target modifiable risk factors, one of which is physical inactivity. The current proposal focuses on the use of an established model of care (cardiac rehabilitation (CR)) and applies it to those who have suffered a TIA in order to maximize physical activity and minimize risk of future cardiovascular events. This will be a one-group pre/post design study with a 3 month non-intervention period. Participants will undergo measures at baseline and 3 months (non intervention period) then after 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation (cardiovascular fitness, 6 minute walk test, cognition, and depressive symptoms).\"\\n            },\\n            \"ConditionsModule\":{\\n              \"ConditionList\":{\\n                \"Condition\":[\\n                  \"Transient Ischemic Attack\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"KeywordList\":{\\n                \"Keyword\":[\\n                  \"cardiac rehab\"\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"DesignModule\":{\\n              \"StudyType\":\"Observational\",\\n              \"PatientRegistry\":\"No\",\\n              \"DesignInfo\":{\\n                \"DesignObservationalModelList\":{\\n                  \"DesignObservationalModel\":[\\n                    \"Cohort\"\\n                  ]\\n                },\\n                \"DesignTimePerspectiveList\":{\\n                  \"DesignTimePerspective\":[\\n                    \"Prospective\"\\n                  ]\\n                }\\n              },\\n              \"EnrollmentInfo\":{\\n                \"EnrollmentCount\":\"20\",\\n                \"EnrollmentType\":\"Actual\"\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"ArmsInterventionsModule\":{\\n              \"ArmGroupList\":{\\n                \"ArmGroup\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"Exercise\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"Following a 3 month non intervention period, participants will participate in Cardiac Rehabilitation, carrying out an exercise program which will last 6 months and combine both resistance and aerobic training.\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupInterventionList\":{\\n                      \"ArmGroupInterventionName\":[\\n                        \"Behavioral: Cardiac Rehabilitation\"\\n                      ]\\n                    }\\n                  }\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"InterventionList\":{\\n                \"Intervention\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"InterventionType\":\"Behavioral\",\\n                    \"InterventionName\":\"Cardiac Rehabilitation\",\\n                    \"InterventionDescription\":\"Individualized cardiac rehabilitation for 6 months, including health education sessions, as well as supervised exercise classes which include aerobic and resistance training.\",\\n                    \"InterventionArmGroupLabelList\":{\\n                      \"InterventionArmGroupLabel\":[\\n                        \"Exercise\"\\n                      ]\\n                    }\\n                  }\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"OutcomesModule\":{\\n              \"PrimaryOutcomeList\":{\\n                \"PrimaryOutcome\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeMeasure\":\"Functional Walk Test\",\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeDescription\":\"6 minute walk test: the longest distance a person can walk for a duration of 6 minutes\",\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame\":\"Baseline, 3 months, 6 months (Six Minute Walk Distance)\"\\n                  },{\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeMeasure\":\"Cardiovascular Fitness (VO2peak)\",\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeDescription\":\"To measure cardiovascular fitness, a stress test on either an upright cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 200P, Germany), or a treadmill (same modality pre- and post-training) was performed depending on patient balance and comfort.\",\\n                    \"PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame\":\"Baseline (after the 3 month non-intervention period) and after 6 months of participation.\"\\n                  }\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"SecondaryOutcomeList\":{\\n                \"SecondaryOutcome\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure\":\"Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).\",\\n                    \"SecondaryOutcomeDescription\":\"Depressive symptoms using the validated Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).

as heart attacks and strokes, are very common and can lead to severe disability or death. Changes in the body leading to heart attacks and strokes usually develop over decades as a result of smoking, diet, and lack of exercise, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Changes in lifestyle and diet can significantly reduce the risk of heart diseases. General Practitioners invite 40 to 74 year-olds who have no known heart disease to take part in the NHS Health Check, which measures each person\\'s individual risk of developing a heart attack or stroke and encourages them in a face-to-face meeting to take part in programmes to help them to give up smoking, lose weight etc. where necessary. In this new clinical trial the investigators will test whether computer-tailored electronic (e)-coaching via email and the internet can help people make the necessary changes in their lifestyle to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\",\\n              \"DetailedDescription\":\"Heart Attack Prevention Programme for You London (HAPPY London) will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial comparing the use of tailored e-coaching in addition to the standard of care vs. standard care alone. Standard care is defined as the care that would be offered by the NHS Health Check programme through the NHS primary care. We will use a range of established and novel cardiovascular markers to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of e-coaching and gain pathophysiological insight into how lifestyle modifications affect the cardiovascular system. These measures include cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), aortic stiffness parameters, vascular ultrasound and other biomarkers of CV disease risk.\\\\n\\\\nIntervention\\\\n\\\\nThe HAPPY London web-based tool will provide the participant with an individualised score for their lifestyle and 10 year CV risk score, based on the modified Framingham score and the UK specific QRisk Score, and provide tailored advice and education on the suboptimal factors. Ideal targets will be set and the information will be updated at 3 and 6 months allowing the participant to view their progress. Weekly emails with brief health and lifestyle advice will be sent to encourage healthier behaviour based on clinical studies or topical issues in the media. Links to social networks, such as Facebook posting and the ability to allow chosen \\'buddies\\' from family or friends to view their progress will aim to further encourage healthier behaviour.\\\\n\\\\nThe study involves the recruitment of 400 adults between the age of 40 and 74 years who have a moderate to high 10-year CV risk score (Estimated 10 year CV risk >10%). Half of the study group will receive use of the e-coaching in addition to standard care allocated randomly stratified according to either moderate (QRisk between 10 and 20%) or high risk (QRisk more than or equal to 20%). The initial screening will take place on the www.happylondon.info web-based \\'mini-check\\' questionnaire. Potential participants will then be seen at a physical screening visit to confirm eligibility. 3 subsequent visits will take place over 6 months; baseline, 3 month and 6 month follow up. A subgroup of the study population (65 from each intervention arm thus totalling 130 participants ) will also have a baseline and follow up cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Assessment will be performed using a variety of measures through questionnaires, blood pressure (BP) checks, blood tests, ultrasound scans, oscillometric method to assess pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis and CMR multi-parametric scanning.\\\\n\\\\nThe primary aim of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of individualised, continuous electronic (e-) coaching to support a healthier lifestyle as a primary prevention tool to reduce the CV risk and improve the quality of life in asymptomatic individuals with intermediate to high 10 year CV risk.\\\\n\\\\nOther questions that we aim to answer are:\\\\n\\\\nIs computer-tailored e-coaching cost-effective in the short-term (clinical trial period) and during the long-term (decision analysis modelling)\\\\nWhat are the associations of personality traits, economic preferences, and sociocultural factors with the achieved lifestyle modifications and changes in the cardiovascular phenotype?\\\\nWhat is the relationship between changes observed in markers derived from our multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging protocols following lifestyle changes?\\\\nHow frequent are silent myocardial infarctions in a typical NHS Health Check population?\\\\nDo treatment effects differ between ethnic groups?\"\\n            },\\n            \"ConditionsModule\":{\\n              \"ConditionList\":{\\n                \"Condition\":[\\n                  \"Cardiovascular Disease\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"KeywordList\":{\\n                \"Keyword\":[\\n                  \"primary prevention\",\\n                  \"Cardiovascular disease\",\\n                  \"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)\",\\n                  \"Electronic coaching (e-coaching)\"\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"DesignModule\":{\\n              \"StudyType\":\"Interventional\",\\n              \"PhaseList\":{\\n                \"Phase\":[\\n                  \"Not Applicable\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"DesignInfo\":{\\n                \"DesignAllocation\":\"Randomized\",\\n                \"DesignInterventionModel\":\"Parallel Assignment\",\\n                \"DesignPrimaryPurpose\":\"Prevention\",\\n                \"DesignMaskingInfo\":{\\n                  \"DesignMasking\":\"Single\",\\n                  \"DesignWhoMaskedList\":{\\n                    \"DesignWhoMasked\":[\\n                      \"Outcomes Assessor\"\\n                    ]\\n                  }\\n                }\\n              },\\n              \"EnrollmentInfo\":{\\n                \"EnrollmentCount\":\"402\",\\n                \"EnrollmentType\":\"Actual\"\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"ArmsInterventionsModule\":{\\n              \"ArmGroupList\":{\\n                \"ArmGroup\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"Standard care\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupType\":\"No Intervention\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"Usual care that would be provided by the NHS Health Check or equivalent.\"\\n                  },{\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"Electronic coaching plus standard care\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupType\":\"Experimental\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"Tailored coaching for participants randomised to use the HAPPY e-coaching tool.

Patients will take part in exercise sessions and education lessons, tailored to meet their personal needs. The exercise training component of cardiac rehabilitation may be delivered as intervals of short intense sessions (also known as high intensity intervals) or the current standard care of longer but less intense sessions (moderate intense intervals). Both exercises have been shown to increase fitness levels and also prevent future risk of heart disease.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of high intensity interval exercise training (HIIT) in patients who had a recent cardiac revascularization procedure or recovering from a heart attack, in comparison to current standard of moderate intensity exercise training in terms of their physical fitness and psychological well-being.\",\\n              \"DetailedDescription\":\"Cardiac rehabilitation is an eight week program designed to help patients regain good health through changed lifestyle after a possible heart attack, heart surgery or other heart problems. Patients will take part in exercise sessions and education lessons, tailored to meet their personal needs. The exercise training component of cardiac rehabilitation may be delivered as intervals of short intense sessions (also known as high intensity intervals) or the current standard care of longer but less intense sessions (moderate intense intervals). Both exercises have been shown to increase fitness levels and also prevent future risk of heart disease. Although there is some evidence to suggest that high intensity interval training produces better body muscles recovery and fitness during cardiac rehabilitation, many important health outcomes have not yet been determined. Such outcomes include the ability of the body to safely control blood pressure and heartbeat rate. Others include health-related quality of life and emotional well-being.\\\\n\\\\nThis study will explore whether there are any differences in health outcomes before and after the introduction of the intervention for patients undergoing high intensity interval exercise compared to those on moderate intensity interval exercise in terms of the recovery of the ability to control blood pressure and heartbeat rate, and also health-related quality of life and emotional well-being. In addition, patients\\' opinions will be sought regarding pain levels, the acceptability and the extent of enjoyment they get from each of the two types of exercise training.\\\\n\\\\nFor each patient, their exercise program will be designed to match their preferences and requirements. Some may prefer to work in a gym environment and so will have their program designed around this type of activity. Others may prefer to work in a group exercise circuit, with their program matched to what is available. When comparing the two types of exercise, everything will be kept the same; from the warm up and cool down, to the types of movements; the only thing that will change is the intensity of the exercise.\\\\n\\\\nBefore and after the eight week training program, patients will be asked to have an assessment to measure the effects that the exercise has on their body. Things like heart rate and blood pressure will be taken and they will also undergo a physical fitness test.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the training, patients will complete questionnaires to establish their level of enjoyment of the program, how motivated they were to complete it. In addition, their quality of life and emotional well-being will be measured by completing questionnaires before and after the 8 weeks of the cardiac rehabilitation program. The investigators anticipate that a total of 46 patients will be recruited for the study over a period of 6 months. In the United Kingdom, it is believed that delivering an improved exercise training program has the potential to enhance patients\\' recovery from heart disease that may reduce the need for hospital services and therefore a better use of the National Health Service resources.\"\\n            },\\n            \"ConditionsModule\":{\\n              \"ConditionList\":{\\n                \"Condition\":[\\n                  \"Heart Disease\",\\n                  \"Heart Attacks\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"KeywordList\":{\\n                \"Keyword\":[\\n                  \"High intensity Interval Exercise training\",\\n                  \"Cardiac rehabilitation\",\\n                  \"cardiac revascularisation\",\\n                  \"Percutaneous coronary interventions\",\\n                  \"Cardiac surgery\"\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"DesignModule\":{\\n              \"StudyType\":\"Interventional\",\\n              \"PhaseList\":{\\n                \"Phase\":[\\n                  \"Not Applicable\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"DesignInfo\":{\\n                \"DesignAllocation\":\"Randomized\",\\n                \"DesignInterventionModel\":\"Parallel Assignment\",\\n                \"DesignPrimaryPurpose\":\"Treatment\",\\n                \"DesignMaskingInfo\":{\\n                  \"DesignMasking\":\"None (Open Label)\"\\n                }\\n              },\\n              \"EnrollmentInfo\":{\\n                \"EnrollmentCount\":\"34\",\\n                \"EnrollmentType\":\"Actual\"\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"ArmsInterventionsModule\":{\\n              \"ArmGroupList\":{\\n                \"ArmGroup\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"High intensity interval training (HIIT)\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupType\":\"Experimental\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"Patients will undergo a 15-minute warm-up, followed by a 24-minute conditioning phase, and a 10-minute cool-down.

\"BriefSummary\":\"Heart disease and heart attacks pose a serious health risk to young women, and women tend to experience less successful recoveries after a heart attack than men do. This study will examine various factors that may predispose women to heart attacks and to poor recovery after a heart attack. The differences between men and women in the medical care that they receive following a heart attack will also be studied.\",\\n              \"DetailedDescription\":\"Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in women 55 years and younger, accounting for more than 8,000 deaths each year in the United States. Approximately 40,000 young women are hospitalized each year in the United States as a result of a heart attack. Research has shown that young women who have heart attacks are twice as likely to die in the hospital as young men who have heart attacks. While there has been an increase in awareness, little research has been conducted on understanding heart disease and heart attacks in young women. Specific biologic markers involved with inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, sex hormones, and genetics may indicate a predisposition to a heart attack and poor recovery. This study will analyze the biologic, demographic, psychosocial, environmental, and behavioral factors that may contribute to premature heart disease and to poor recovery after a heart attack in women. Researchers will examine if delays in receiving medical care following a heart attack can affect recovery and health outcomes for women. Gender differences in outcomes and the quality of medical care that is received following a heart attack will also be examined.\\\\n\\\\nThis study will enroll women and men who are hospitalized following a possible heart attack. At study entry, participants will be interviewed to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. A medical record review will also occur. At 1 month after admission from the hospital, an interview will occur via phone and a blood sample will be collected when the participant returns to the hospital or alternatively be collected at a medical clinic convenient to the participant. Another telephone interview will occur at 12 months. Participants\\' blood samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies.\"\\n            },\\n            \"ConditionsModule\":{\\n              \"ConditionList\":{\\n                \"Condition\":[\\n                  \"Acute Myocardial Infarction\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"KeywordList\":{\\n                \"Keyword\":[\\n                  \"Acute Myocardial Infarction\",\\n                  \"Heart Attack\",\\n                  \"Gender Differences\",\\n                  \"Risk Factors\",\\n                  \"Quality of Care\"\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"DesignModule\":{\\n              \"StudyType\":\"Observational\",\\n              \"DesignInfo\":{\\n                \"DesignObservationalModelList\":{\\n                  \"DesignObservationalModel\":[\\n                    \"Cohort\"\\n                  ]\\n                },\\n                \"DesignTimePerspectiveList\":{\\n                  \"DesignTimePerspective\":[\\n                    \"Prospective\"\\n                  ]\\n                }\\n              },\\n              \"BioSpec\":{\\n                \"BioSpecRetention\":\"Samples With DNA\",\\n                \"BioSpecDescription\":\"Blood specimens for biomarker analysis and storage for future genetic studies\"\\n              },\\n              \"EnrollmentInfo\":{\\n                \"EnrollmentCount\":\"2985\",\\n                \"EnrollmentType\":\"Actual\"\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"ArmsInterventionsModule\":{\\n              \"ArmGroupList\":{\\n                \"ArmGroup\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"1\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"2,000 women between the ages of 18 and 55 years who are hospitalized with a heart attack\"\\n                  },{\\n                    \"ArmGroupLabel\":\"2\",\\n                    \"ArmGroupDescription\":\"1,000 men between the ages of 18 and 55 years who are hospitalized with a heart attack\"\\n                  }\\n                ]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            \"EligibilityModule\":{\\n              \"EligibilityCriteria\":\"Inclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\nElevated cardiac markers within 24 hours of arrival at initial or enrolling institution\\\\nSupporting evidence suggestive of a heart attack\\\\n\\\\nExclusion Criteria:\\\\n\\\\nPreviously enrolled in the VIRGO study\\\\nDoes not speak English or Spanish\\\\nToo ill to interview\\\\nCurrent prisoner\",\\n              \"HealthyVolunteers\":\"No\",\\n              \"Gender\":\"All\",\\n              \"MinimumAge\":\"18 Years\",\\n              \"MaximumAge\":\"55 Years\",\\n              \"StdAgeList\":{\\n                \"StdAge\":[\\n                  \"Adult\"\\n                ]\\n              },\\n              \"StudyPopulation\":\"2,000 women and 1,000 men between the ages of 18 and 55 years who are hospitalized with a heart attack\",\\n              \"SamplingMethod\":\"Non-Probability Sample\"\\n            },\\n            \"ContactsLocationsModule\":{\\n              \"OverallOfficialList\":{\\n                \"OverallOfficial\":[\\n                  {\\n                    \"OverallOfficialName\":\"Harlan M.

5% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had previously ischemic stroke (IS) or transitory ischemic attack (TIA). This is a high-risk population, with a high incidence of ischemic events, and also of bleeding events. While the high ischemic risk in this population is attributed to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, their predisposition to bleeding events is not well understood. Hypothesis: The increased bleeding risk in ACS patients with history of cerebrovascular event may be justified by a low platelet activity. Methods: Unicentric, prospective, case-control study, which included approximately 100 post-ACS patients with history of IS/TIA previously to the acute coronary event (Case Group) and 100 patients without IS/TIA (Control group). The groups were matched for gender, age, and ACS type and year of occurrence. All patients were taking aspirin, and the main exclusion criteria were use of dual antiplatelet therapy, previous hemorrhagic stroke, severe renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. Main analysis: Platelet aggregation was evaluated by 6 methods: VerifyNow Aspirin®, VerifyNow P2Y12®, PFA 100®, thrombelastography (ReoRox®), light transmission aggregometry with ADP (LTA ADP) and epinephrine (LTA EPI) as agonists.

Once an individual has suffered a TIA, preventative measures can be taken to target modifiable risk factors, one of which is physical inactivity. The current proposal focuses on the use of an established model of care (cardiac rehabilitation (CR)) and applies it to those who have suffered a TIA in order to maximize physical activity and minimize risk of future cardiovascular events. This will be a one-group pre/post design study with a 3 month non-intervention period. Participants will undergo measures at baseline and 3 months (non intervention period) then after 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation (cardiovascular fitness, 6 minute walk test, cognition, and depressive symptoms).'},\n",

Changes in the body leading to heart attacks and strokes usually develop over decades as a result of smoking, diet, and lack of exercise, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Changes in lifestyle and diet can significantly reduce the risk of heart diseases. General Practitioners invite 40 to 74 year-olds who have no known heart disease to take part in the NHS Health Check, which measures each person's individual risk of developing a heart attack or stroke and encourages them in a face-to-face meeting to take part in programmes to help them to give up smoking, lose weight etc. where necessary. In this new clinical trial the investigators will test whether computer-tailored electronic (e)-coaching via email and the internet can help people make the necessary changes in their lifestyle to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\",\n",
       "       'DetailedDescription': \"Heart Attack Prevention Programme for You London (HAPPY London) will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial comparing the use of tailored e-coaching in addition to the standard of care vs. standard care alone. Standard care is defined as the care that would be offered by the NHS Health Check programme through the NHS primary care. We will use a range of established and novel cardiovascular markers to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of e-coaching and gain pathophysiological insight into how lifestyle modifications affect the cardiovascular system. These measures include cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), aortic stiffness parameters, vascular ultrasound and other biomarkers of CV disease risk.\\n\\nIntervention\\n\\nThe HAPPY London web-based tool will provide the participant with an individualised score for their lifestyle and 10 year CV risk score, based on the modified Framingham score and the UK specific QRisk Score, and provide tailored advice and education on the suboptimal factors. Ideal targets will be set and the information will be updated at 3 and 6 months allowing the participant to view their progress. Weekly emails with brief health and lifestyle advice will be sent to encourage healthier behaviour based on clinical studies or topical issues in the media. Links to social networks, such as Facebook posting and the ability to allow chosen 'buddies' from family or friends to view their progress will aim to further encourage healthier behaviour.\\n\\nThe study involves the recruitment of 400 adults between the age of 40 and 74 years who have a moderate to high 10-year CV risk score (Estimated 10 year CV risk >10%). Half of the study group will receive use of the e-coaching in addition to standard care allocated randomly stratified according to either moderate (QRisk between 10 and 20%) or high risk (QRisk more than or equal to 20%). The initial screening will take place on the www.happylondon.info web-based 'mini-check' questionnaire. Potential participants will then be seen at a physical screening visit to confirm eligibility. 3 subsequent visits will take place over 6 months; baseline, 3 month and 6 month follow up. A subgroup of the study population (65 from each intervention arm thus totalling 130 participants ) will also have a baseline and follow up cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Assessment will be performed using a variety of measures through questionnaires, blood pressure (BP) checks, blood tests, ultrasound scans, oscillometric method to assess pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis and CMR multi-parametric scanning.\\n\\nThe primary aim of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of individualised, continuous electronic (e-) coaching to support a healthier lifestyle as a primary prevention tool to reduce the CV risk and improve the quality of life in asymptomatic individuals with intermediate to high 10 year CV risk.\\n\\nOther questions that we aim to answer are:\\n\\nIs computer-tailored e-coaching cost-effective in the short-term (clinical trial period) and during the long-term (decision analysis modelling)\\nWhat are the associations of personality traits, economic preferences, and sociocultural factors with the achieved lifestyle modifications and changes in the cardiovascular phenotype?\\nWhat is the relationship between changes observed in markers derived from our multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging protocols following lifestyle changes?\\nHow frequent are silent myocardial infarctions in a typical NHS Health Check population?\\nDo treatment effects differ between ethnic groups?\"},\n",

Primary endpoint is change in LDL levels between the 2 arms. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure control, weight, smoking cessation, and other lifestyle modifications.\\n\\nThis trial will help us understand whether coronary artery disease risk derived from genetic information would have a significant impact on patients' perception of coronary artery disease risk and motivate healthy lifestyle modifications that reduce their long term risk.\"},\n",

Patients will take part in exercise sessions and education lessons, tailored to meet their personal needs. The exercise training component of cardiac rehabilitation may be delivered as intervals of short intense sessions (also known as high intensity intervals) or the current standard care of longer but less intense sessions (moderate intense intervals). Both exercises have been shown to increase fitness levels and also prevent future risk of heart disease.\\n\\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of high intensity interval exercise training (HIIT) in patients who had a recent cardiac revascularization procedure or recovering from a heart attack, in comparison to current standard of moderate intensity exercise training in terms of their physical fitness and psychological well-being.',\n",
       "       'DetailedDescription': \"Cardiac rehabilitation is an eight week program designed to help patients regain good health through changed lifestyle after a possible heart attack, heart surgery or other heart problems. Patients will take part in exercise sessions and education lessons, tailored to meet their personal needs. The exercise training component of cardiac rehabilitation may be delivered as intervals of short intense sessions (also known as high intensity intervals) or the current standard care of longer but less intense sessions (moderate intense intervals). Both exercises have been shown to increase fitness levels and also prevent future risk of heart disease. Although there is some evidence to suggest that high intensity interval training produces better body muscles recovery and fitness during cardiac rehabilitation, many important health outcomes have not yet been determined. Such outcomes include the ability of the body to safely control blood pressure and heartbeat rate. Others include health-related quality of life and emotional well-being.\\n\\nThis study will explore whether there are any differences in health outcomes before and after the introduction of the intervention for patients undergoing high intensity interval exercise compared to those on moderate intensity interval exercise in terms of the recovery of the ability to control blood pressure and heartbeat rate, and also health-related quality of life and emotional well-being. In addition, patients' opinions will be sought regarding pain levels, the acceptability and the extent of enjoyment they get from each of the two types of exercise training.\\n\\nFor each patient, their exercise program will be designed to match their preferences and requirements. Some may prefer to work in a gym environment and so will have their program designed around this type of activity. Others may prefer to work in a group exercise circuit, with their program matched to what is available. When comparing the two types of exercise, everything will be kept the same; from the warm up and cool down, to the types of movements; the only thing that will change is the intensity of the exercise.\\n\\nBefore and after the eight week training program, patients will be asked to have an assessment to measure the effects that the exercise has on their body. Things like heart rate and blood pressure will be taken and they will also undergo a physical fitness test.\\n\\nAfter the training, patients will complete questionnaires to establish their level of enjoyment of the program, how motivated they were to complete it. In addition, their quality of life and emotional well-being will be measured by completing questionnaires before and after the 8 weeks of the cardiac rehabilitation program. The investigators anticipate that a total of 46 patients will be recruited for the study over a period of 6 months. In the United Kingdom, it is believed that delivering an improved exercise training program has the potential to enhance patients' recovery from heart disease that may reduce the need for hospital services and therefore a better use of the National Health Service resources.\"},\n",

This study will examine various factors that may predispose women to heart attacks and to poor recovery after a heart attack. The differences between men and women in the medical care that they receive following a heart attack will also be studied.',\n",
       "       'DetailedDescription': \"Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in women 55 years and younger, accounting for more than 8,000 deaths each year in the United States. Approximately 40,000 young women are hospitalized each year in the United States as a result of a heart attack. Research has shown that young women who have heart attacks are twice as likely to die in the hospital as young men who have heart attacks. While there has been an increase in awareness, little research has been conducted on understanding heart disease and heart attacks in young women. Specific biologic markers involved with inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, sex hormones, and genetics may indicate a predisposition to a heart attack and poor recovery. This study will analyze the biologic, demographic, psychosocial, environmental, and behavioral factors that may contribute to premature heart disease and to poor recovery after a heart attack in women. Researchers will examine if delays in receiving medical care following a heart attack can affect recovery and health outcomes for women. Gender differences in outcomes and the quality of medical care that is received following a heart attack will also be examined.\\n\\nThis study will enroll women and men who are hospitalized following a possible heart attack. At study entry, participants will be interviewed to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. A medical record review will also occur. At 1 month after admission from the hospital, an interview will occur via phone and a blood sample will be collected when the participant returns to the hospital or alternatively be collected at a medical clinic convenient to the participant. Another telephone interview will occur at 12 months. Participants' blood samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies.\"},\n",

This is a high-risk population, with a high incidence of ischemic events, and also of bleeding events. While the high ischemic risk in this population is attributed to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, their predisposition to bleeding events is not well understood. Hypothesis: The increased bleeding risk in ACS patients with history of cerebrovascular event may be justified by a low platelet activity. Methods: Unicentric, prospective, case-control study, which included approximately 100 post-ACS patients with history of IS/TIA previously to the acute coronary event (Case Group) and 100 patients without IS/TIA (Control group). The groups were matched for gender, age, and ACS type and year of occurrence. All patients were taking aspirin, and the main exclusion criteria were use of dual antiplatelet therapy, previous hemorrhagic stroke, severe renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. Main analysis: Platelet aggregation was evaluated by 6 methods: VerifyNow Aspirin®, VerifyNow P2Y12®, PFA 100®, thrombelastography (ReoRox®), light transmission aggregometry with ADP (LTA ADP) and epinephrine (LTA EPI) as agonists. Additional analysis: genetic, HDL transport and inflammatory evaliation'},\n",

For neural networks, the parameters are the weights. In linear regression, the model parameters are the coefficients. Model hyper-parameters are the inputs to the modeling algorithm that have an effect on the model that is produced, but are provided by the user, and are not learned. For example, in random forest, the number of trees to construct, the maximum tree depth, and the number of features to consider at a given node for splitting, are all model hyper-parameters.

For a given individual, a bit is given a value of 1 if that feature is expressed in the individual, and a 0 otherwise. Given an initial population, the genetic algorithm evaluates the *fitness*, or objective function, for each individual. Some of the better solutions are selected and modified (*crossover* and *mutation*) to produce a new population, or *generation*. This process is iterated until some solution fitness level is achieved, or the maximum number of iterations is reached."

First, you could limit the range of possible value for a given feature. For example, we could limit the range of number of trees from 1 to 1000. We could encode values in this range with 10 bits. Limiting the range of max depth from 1-10 means we could encode these values in 4 bits. Limiting the minimum observations from 1 - 20 means we could encode these values in 5 bits. Overall, a given solution could be represented as a 19-bit value. Of course, some encoding would not be valid, and the algorithms would have to check for these."
