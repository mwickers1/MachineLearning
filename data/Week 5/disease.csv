Not yet recruiting,"August 1, 2019",3 Years,,Anticipated,150,"The main objective of this study is to apply a well-established model of developmental surveillance (which evolved to characterize the outcomes of very low birth weight infants) to infants with genetic disorders. A novel clinical model for infants with rare genetic disorders has been created as a joint initiative between the Division of Newborn Medicine's NICU Growth and Developmental Support Programs (NICU GraDS) program and the Division of Genetics at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This study plans to enroll patients with genetic syndromes seen in this clinic into a prospective, longitudinal study in order to characterize their developmental profiles and needs. Related factors such as quality of life and parental stress will also be assessed which will complement the evaluation of the role of a ""developmental home"" for these high risk infants. It is also hypothesized that gaps in care - mismatches between services received and services indicated based upon the developmental evaluation - will be identified. The results of this study will be used to inform future research efforts utilizing targeted approaches to improve developmental outcomes.

For infants with rare genetic disorders, the aims are as follows:

Aim 1: Characterize physical and psychosocial development using standardized longitudinal assessments.

Aim 2: Identify developmental service needs, prescription, and utilization.

Aim 3: Assess parental stress and health-related quality of life.","The main objective of this study is to apply a well-established model of developmental surveillance (which evolved to characterize the outcomes of very low birth weight infants) to infants with genetic disorders.

Completed,October 1994,,,,1200,"Individuals and their families affected by disorders with a potentially genetic basis within six broad categories will be evaluated over time to characterize the natural and clinical history of various specific disorders. Medical and laboratory evaluations will be completed to identify areas of management concern that have not been previously described. Further protocols will be developed addressing specific disorders once a number of affected individuals have been investigated and is sufficient to query various aspects of those disorders. Issues for both diagnosis and medical management of those affected with certain genetic disorders will be collated and addressed within a national consensus conference format. In addition, phenotype to genotype correlation will be established to further understanding of specific molecular alterations on phenotypic expression. This broad-based protocol will also facilitate the training of fellows in medical genetics, graduate and post graduate training in genetics and genetic counseling.","This study will investigate the cause and natural history (medical problems that appear over time) of certain genetic disorders. It will also try to locate the abnormal genes responsible for these conditions and eventually develop tests to predict who is likely to be affected and to what degree.

Patients with known or suspected genetic disorders in certain categories, such as those involving chromosomal or metabolic abnormalities, immune system or blood disorders, abnormal growth, benign tumors, and others may be eligible for this study. Participants will be interviewed by specialists in genetics about their condition and family history. They may also be asked to have a physical examination and certain tests needed for study of the specific individual's condition. These may include collection of blood samples (up to 3 tablespoons); imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and echocardiography; skin biopsy (removal of a small sample of skin tissue under local anesthetic), and other procedures. DNA testing may reveal the genetic abnormality responsible for the disorder. Participants who so wish will have an opportunity to talk with experts about the health implications of the test results.

This study may provide information that will lead to improved treatment or management of these inherited disorders, as well as more effective genetic counseling for families."
Completed,"October 25, 2001",18 Years,,Actual,1090,"The aim of this protocol is to provide care for patients with a variety of rare genetic disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for training in clinical genetics, dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and spearhead the development of new research protocols on particular aspects of diagnosis and care for specific genetic diseases. Evaluations of patients with a broad spectrum of metabolic and genetic conditions will be performed. In addition, genetic counseling services will be offered to patients and their families to assess risk, and give information on preventive measures, and testing options. Disorders that will be studied include chromosomal and Mendelian disorders of childhood and/or adult onset, congenital anomalies and/or birth defects, dysmorphic syndromes, familial cancer syndromes, multifactorial disorders, and metabolic abnormalities.

It will allow NICHD investigators and trainees experience in diagnosing, managing, and treating patients with metabolic and genetic disorders who may not be eligible for an active NIH research trial. Participants in this protocol will only have tests and procedures used in the standard practice of medicine; there will be no experimental tests or treatments. Patients who are found eligible for an active research protocol will be offered participation in that study. The medical evaluations in this trial may uncover new disease processes that prompt new research initiatives.

People of all ages with a suspected or diagnosed genetic or metabolic condition may be eligible for this study. In addition, children with unexplained developmental delay, deafness, dysmorphism, congenital malformations, acidosis, failure to thrive, feeding problems, short stature, birth defects, and other syndromes of unknown cause may qualify.

Participants will have a medical history, including a family history, with possible review of previous medical records, and a physical examination. Other procedures may include:

Consultation with medical specialists.
Hearing and/or vision tests.
Imaging studies, such as X-rays, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Blood drawing Blood samples (2 to 4 tablespoons from adults and 1 to 2 tablespoons from children) may be used for routine lab tests, genetic study, and other research purposes.
Cheek swab DNA may be obtained by a cheek swab. A small brush is rubbed against the inside of the cheek to collect some cells.
Skin biopsy Under local anesthetic, a small circle of skin (about 1/8-inch) is removed with a sharp cutting instrument similar to a cookie cutter.
Muscle biopsy Under local anesthetic, a small piece of muscle tissue is removed to aid in diagnosis.

Participants will undergo only diagnostic procedures that are clinically indicated; that is, only tests needed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis will be done. Tissue samples collected for diagnostic purposes may also be used to obtain DNA for genetic studies and to establish cell lines (cells grown in the laboratory to be maintained indefinitely) for future research.

The results of the medical evaluation may indicate whether or not the participant has the disease that runs in the family (if a genetic disorder is indeed confirmed). Unless he or she requests otherwise, the subject (and parent in the case of a minor) will receive counseling regarding the test results. The implications of a positive test result will be explained, specifically, the participant s risk of having the disease, and the risk of passing the condition on to offspring."
Completed,November 2007,2 Weeks,,Actual,1000,"Summary of Relevant Background Studies: Congenital anomalies play a major role in pediatric care. One of the leading causes of infant mortality in developed countries is the sequelae of these congenital anomalies. In some cases this exceeds the death rate for prematurity, SIDS, and other common causes of infant or neonatal death. The available tools for the assessment of a dysmorphic infant or child are based mainly on the experience of the examiner and his ability to translate findings and measurements from the physical examination to a qualitative and quantitative summary of accepted values plotted for the corresponding age (1,2). Various unusual features are expressed in qualitative terms such as short stature, long fingers, pear-shaped nose, small ears or other terms, which imply a comparison with other body proportions and the subjective impression of the examiner. Following that, an impression of the patient as a 'gestalt' is formed in the examiner's mind.

The databases and most of the written material are descriptive with scarce graphic and photographs, making the comparison of the phenotypic expression of the described subject with the one that needs to be diagnosed a difficult one. Even with the extensive existing data on objective measurements available to characterize a phenotype, many of the physicians involved in the diagnosis of a specific case will base part of their diagnosis on ""it looks like"" and put that impression in the context of other physical and laboratory findings.

Many syndromes in human pathology are recognized by their unique and distinctive facial and body characteristics. These stereotypic phenotypic characteristics are mostly reproducible using anthropometric measurements.

Charts are available for nor+mal data values of various morphometric variables (1,2). However, some of these figures can be accurately measured only on 3D structures (head, face). The following figure demonstrates the measurement of the angle of the palpebral fissure:

Fig. 1: An upward obliquity to the palpebral fissures is known as a mongoloid slant while downward obliquity is referred to as an antimongoloid slant. In order to obtain such measurements within the uterus a 3D configuration and appropriate image analysis is necessary (Figure from Ref. 2).

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an example of a syndrome that underwent characterization by graphic data analysis methods (3). The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was determined in a foster care population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial Photographic Screening Tool. The authors concluded that the screening tool performed with very high accuracy and could be used to track FAS prevalence over time in foster care population to accurately assess the effectiveness of primary prevention. An expert can recognize facial characteristics and provide accurate analysis. Objective measurements could provide less experienced observers with tools that classify anatomical characteristics of different diseases and syndromes. Facial phenotypic patterns can be extracted from large databases of facial surfaces. These biometric measurements can be used for analysis when evaluated with respect to their ""normal"" values in the general population.

3- Methods of Study: Following approval of the Helsinki Committee, the project will be performed in several successive steps as follows: A. Newborn scanning: A database of 3D pictures (scans) of the face of newborn infants will be created. The scanning will be performed initially at the Carmel Medical Center, during their hospital stay. The examinees will be scanned one time, in order to build a database based on the data obtained from each scanned picture.

The facial anthropometric patterns of the obtained 3D pictures will be studied off-line using a computerized face pattern recognition system developed and used at the Faculty of Computer Sciences at the Technion. The measurements obtained will be compared to geometric anthropometric data already in use by medical geneticists and clinicians (1-9).

B. Hardware and software description:

3D Image Acquisition: Special hardware specially prepared in our department was developed for 3D image acquisition of newborn (see figure 2).

The hardware consists in:a structured light projector (DLP Projector Casio 350j,a digital video camera (PTGray Flea CCD Camera (Point Grey Research® Inc.( Black and white (640x480), Aluminum projector cage, Special medical stand with wheels,Personal Computer - Pentium 4 - XP,Flat screen 17"" with stand mount,Firewire cables,I/O cables.

Systems used for image acquisition: Currently there are two basic technologies. One is a laser scan, where a narrow laser generated light plane scans a face in vertical direction and the 3-D structure of the face is recovered based on the form of the light contour at the intersection between the light plane and the face surface.

The second method is based on the so-called structured light technology (regular light), where one or more specially designed light patterns are projected onto a face, and the 3D structure is recovered based on the position measurements of known pattern elements projections on the face.

Next, the range image is converted to a triangulated surface. The mesh can be possibly sub-sampled in order to decrease the amount of data. The choice of the number of sub-samples is a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. Using this technique image acquisition and reconstruction takes about 2-3 seconds.

C. Morphometric parameters and their computation: In order to compute common morphometric parameters like inner and outer cantal distance, interpupillary distance, etc., there is a need to recognize various points of interest in the 3D face. This will be done using various pattern recognition algorithms. At the initial stage a manual procedure will be used to mark features on the projection of the facial surface.

Based on the results of the first phase automatic methods will be developed to detect features using statistical and algebraic algorithms. After having the relevant anchor points secured, simple 3D geometry will be used to compute common morphometric data. Parameters include outer canthal distance, interpupillary distance, palpebral fissure length, palpebral fissure angle, nasal-labial (philtrum) length, ear length, ear height, etc. The 3D data available can be used to try and search for other parameters that might be considered as statistically meaningful indicators.

Another avenue of research is to examine the importance of other metrics for distance estimation. One option is to check the contribution of geodesic distances as indicators. Geodesic distance is a distance map computed on the surface itself (Riemannian metric). A minimal geodesic path is the shortest path on the surface connecting two points.

An efficient method for computing the minimal geodesic distances on a triangulated domain was developed by Kimmel and Sethian (10). As the face is a deformable surface it is important to use such a representation for the facial surface that the measurements performed on it would be invariant to possible deformations (i.e. various facial expressions). In this case a bending invariant surface representation introduced by Elad and Kimmel will be used (11).

D. Statistical methods will be used for detecting the best independent significant morphometric variables which significantly correlate with the various syndromes: Discriminating scores will be constructed using the regression coefficients of the multivariate analysis tests and best cutoff points will be found, predicting between different genetic anomalies. Testing of the method and of the results will be done using a validation group of patients and healthy controls, by independent observers. The syndromatic examined newborn infants will be assessed by a geneticist and confirmation of the diagnosis will be made by laboratory tests when appropriate.

E. Statistical Power and number of patients: Many morphometrical variables will be assessed, based on our 3D reconstructing methods. Only after applying the multivariate analysis on the results, the relative diagnostic importance of each variable will be revealed. Thus, no single variable can be considered at this point, as an absolute discriminator between normal and abnormal value. However, if considering for example only one 3D morphometric variable, such as the degree of palpebral fissure slanting, in order to discriminate between ""Trisomy 21"" and ""normal"" in the Caucasian population, the following power analysis can be computed: The average and SD values of the slanting eye angle in ""normal"" is: 3.5 (degrees) ± 1.5. In a Trisomy 21 patient, there is an upward shift of this value. In order to detect a shift of more than 2 SD's (i.e. of more than 3 degree) and supposing that the SD will be larger than 3 degrees in the pathological population we need a minimal number of 21 patients and controls, in order to obtain a statistical power of 90%.

Total number of patients: Our purpose is to obtain scans from 800 newborn infants during the two year study period.","The hypothesis to be tested: After the construction of a database of anthropometric measurements, the system would extract important features of a given facial surface and be able to match it with existing morphometric figures. A given combination of normal and abnormal measurements will open a ""probable diagnosis"" and a list of ""differential diagnosis"" that will be expressed as percent of matching in a descendent order to the examiner."

Recruiting,"March 1, 2018",,3 Months,Anticipated,500,"The goal of this research protocol is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the benefits and risks of incorporating whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a first line diagnostic test in various genetic and sub-specialty clinics within a large, tertiary medical center.

The investigators will enroll 500 participants within the Partners HealthCare system (e.g. Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, etc.). The study will be enrolling from multiple genetics and sub-specialty clinics, including but not limited to: cardiology, GI cancer genetics, medical genetics, ataxia, endocrine genetics. Participants are eligible if their provider orders genetic testing for diagnosis of symptoms suspicious for a genetic disorder. Participants must not have had a genetic workup in the past.

At the time of enrollment, a small blood sample will be obtained at the time of the participant's blood draw for standard-of-care testing. All participants will be subject to 1:1 randomization, in which 250 will receive a WGS report, and 250 will be randomized to the arm that receives standard of care testing only. Any WGS report that is generated will be incorporated into the patient's electronic medical record.

For pediatric patients, the study team will attempt to collect blood samples from both biological parents when possible for trio analysis (WGS performed on the proband and both biological parents). The purpose of trio analysis is primarily for the purpose of interpreting the proband/child's results. For non-pediatric patients, saliva samples may be requested from living parents for confirmation purposes. No genetic testing reports will be generated for parents. The exception to this is if a parent of a pediatric patient (part of trio) opts to receive results from the ACMG 59 list.

The participants are blinded to the arm in which they are assigned until 3-4 months from the time of consent. At that time, a study genetic counselor will call the participant to disclose the randomization assignment. If the participant was randomized to receive a WGS report, a plan will be made to review the WGS either by phone, video conferencing, or in person. After reviewing the results, the research team will write a letter to the participant summarizing the results and any relevant medical management recommendations. This letter will also include a copy of their WGS report.

All participants (or their parents) will be surveyed at three points during their enrollment: baseline (at time of consent), immediately post-disclosure, and 6 months post-disclosure. The medical providers who offered the standard of care testing will also be surveyed.","The study ""Investigating the Feasibility and Implementation of Whole Genome Sequencing in Patients With Suspected Genetic Disorder"" is a research study that aims to explore the use of whole genome sequencing as a potential first line genetic test for patients for which a genetic diagnosis is suspected. This is an internally funded research study.

At the time of their standard-of-care genetic testing, an extra blood sample will be collected, and genome sequencing may be performed. Within 3-4 months, patients learn if they received genome sequencing or not, and any results are returned and explained. Investigators are also studying the experiences of both participants and their providers to better understand how to implement genome sequencing into clinical care."

Not yet recruiting,"November 1, 2018",120 Years,1 Year,Anticipated,3000,"Recent advances in biotechnology have shown that somatic cells (such as skin, blood and urine cells) from human adults and children can be reprogrammed to change their characteristics and become other types of cells that may be useful for disease modelling and drug screening. This includes the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) which can be derived from these somatic cells by a process known as ""cellular reprogramming"". These iPSCs share many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, including an unlimited capacity for proliferation and the potential to differentiate into any cell of the body. However, unlike embryonic stem cells, the generation of iPSCs avoids the practical and ethical difficulties of obtaining embryonic tissues. Consequently, cellular reprogramming and iPSC technology has great implications in the field of disease modelling and drug screening.

Many obstacles must be overcome before iPSC based disease modelling and drug screening can fully be realised and allow replacement of inadequate animal models and simplistic cell models. This study will enable us to gather samples from a range of participants from different disease backgrounds, and to develop suitable panels of iPSCs for the purpose of protocol development. Development of robust protocols which are suitable for use across multiple iPSC lines and repeatable across multiple laboratories are essential for the use of iPSCs in disease modelling and drug screening. This study will allow us to look at causation of disease across a range of disease specific cell lines with known genetic backgrounds which are representative of a cohort of human patients. This is fundamental for development of iPSC based drug screening assays.","Recent advances have shown that cells from human blood, skin and urine samples can be reprogrammed to become stem cells. These are called induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and share many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, including an unlimited capacity for proliferation and the potential to become any cell in the body. Beneficially, the use of iPSCs avoids the ethical difficulties which surround embryonic stem cells and allows generation of iPSC lines which are disease representative. For example, we could take skin samples from an individual diagnosed with Huntington's disease and their unaffected sibling and using this technology, generate iPSC lines from both individuals. Using these iPSCs, we could produce disease affected cell populations from the affected and unaffected individuals, use these cells to research why specific cell populations are affected by disease and test new treatments to combat disease progression, essentially producing a 'disease in a dish'. This is just one example of many for which this technology could be applied. We can also utilise gene-editing techniques to generate isogenic controls or insert disease related mutations to assess disease phenotype.

Although generation of iPSC lines has been robustly proven across multiple disease backgrounds, many aspects of their downstream use still remain to be determined. Particularly, robust protocols for directing iPSCs towards cell fates such as neurons or blood cells must be developed to fully realise application of iPSCs in disease modelling and drug screening.

This study involves the collection of human blood, skin or urine samples from subjects bearing a range of genetic diseases alongside those from individuals who have not been diagnosed with a disease, as controls. These samples will be used to generate iPSC lines for development of differentiation and disease phenotyping protocols."
Recruiting,"October 22, 2014",99 Years,,Anticipated,500,"This study is designed to evaluate patients with suspected or identified novel immune disorders, with a focus on abnormal immune homeostasis potentially due to defects in activation or apoptosis. Blood relatives of enrolled patients will also be evaluated. Affected individuals may have Mendelian gene defects involving mostly single or occasionally multiple genes. These patients may have signs and symptoms suggestive of clinically significant lymphocyte homeostasis disorders. However, some selected patients manifesting autoimmunity, autoinflammatory conditions, end-organ dysfunction, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, frequent infections, allergies, or laboratory abnormalities consistent with immune defects of research interest to the Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases may also be studied under this protocol at the discretion of the Investigators.

This protocol will facilitate the discovery of the role of genetic pathways and modes of inheritance associated with pathophysiological events leading to immune system dysregulation, particularly disorders of immune cell homeostasis. A better understanding of the genetics as well as biochemical and molecular basis of complex immune disorders could also lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets and approaches.

Patients will undergo clinical evaluations that include history and physical examinations, blood sampling, radiological exams, genetic testing, skin biopsy, and other medically indicated procedures. Genetically related family members of patients may also be evaluated or screened for clinical, in vitro, and genetic correlates of immune abnormalities. Patients and relatives unable or too sick to travel to NIH Clinical Center (CC) may be evaluated through mail-in blood samples.

Not yet recruiting,June 2019,,,Anticipated,15,,"The advent of high throughput genomic DNA sequencing has led to major advances in the diagnosis of genetic diseases of heterogeneous origin. Thus, our hospital laboratory has developed in recent years several diagnostic tests based on the targeted sequencing of coding sequences of gene panels (from about twenty genes for DNA repair diseases to nearly five hundred genes for the intellectual disability). These targeted analyzes, carried out by capture, have thus solved 25 to 80% of the cases according to the indications, without allowing the diagnosis of the totality of the patients.

For these negative cases, the search for mutations in the coding sequences was then extended to Whole Exome Sequencing, thus providing several additional diagnoses.

Patients still remain without diagnosis after this exome study. These could be complex cases of genetic or even non-genetic origin, but also monogenic pathologies linked to mutations that are not identifiable by coding sequence analyzes, and especially affecting messenger RNAs."
Completed,"August 1, 2006",99 Years,2 Years,Actual,87,"Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms that have been increasingly associated with human disease, commonly involving the lung. Post menopausal Caucasian women seem particularly predisposed to the development of peripheral nodules and dilated airways (bronchiectasis) associated with these organisms. These women have distinguishing body characteristics of being taller and thinner than age and gender matched controls yet have no identifiable systemic immune defects. There is, however, considerable overlap with genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The Genetic Diseases of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) is one of 10 consortia in the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network formed under the Office of Rare Diseases in collaboration with NCRR, NICHD, NINDS, NIAMS, NIDDK, NHLBI in response to the Rare Diseases Act of 2002. The GDMCC is comprised of 5 geographically-dispersed clinical research sites that are designed to study rare diseases which involve defects in clearance of mucus secretions from the airways (defective ""mucociliary clearance""). These sites will collaborate in diagnostic, genetic, and other studies in patients with impairments of mucociliary clearance, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF), and pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). These studies are also applicable to diseases where altered airways clearance may play a primary or contributory role such as nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, chronic granulomatous disease, and the hyper-IgE syndromes. Disorders such as PCD, CF, and PHA reflect genetic defects in airway host-defense, and typically result in chronic infection of the airways. Patients with these disorders of the conducting airways and sinuses have delayed (or incorrect) diagnoses, because diagnostic tests are not readily available. These patients may also have sub-optimal management of their clinical disease, because the cause of these disorders is not well-defined, and treatment regimens are usually not driven by evidence-based medicine.

Aims: The major aim of this study is to employ a systematic approach to the diagnostic and functional evaluation of these patients with chronic airways disease in individual patients, better define host susceptibility to infections from environmental organisms such as the nontuberculous mycobacteria, and potentially lead to the development of better diagnostic techniques, including genetic testing. In addition, we will compare/contrast clinical features (phenotype) across these disorders. A rigorous cross-sectional comparison of the clinical features will provide better understanding of the clinical disease of these disorders; in turn this will lead not only to a better standard of clinical care, but will also assist in the identification of novel therapeutic approaches.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic / mechanistic protocol to investigate airway host-defenses. The patient populations for these studies include individuals with recurring airway infections such as those with nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease who may have defective airway host defenses as a predisposing factor, individuals carrying a tentative diagnosis of the three known genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance (PCD, variant CF, or PHA), and individuals suspected to have one of these disorders but with inadequate or inconclusive diagnostic tests. Individuals in this latter category must have a preliminary clinical evaluation to evaluate for other more common disorders that may have similar manifestations including classical CF, immunodeficiency, asthma, and severe gastroesophageal reflux. The evaluation will include a detailed assessment of clinical features; specialized laboratory measurements such as nasal potential difference to evaluate the function of chloride and sodium channels associated with CF and PHA, nasal biopsy specimens and nasal nitric oxide measurements to assess cilia structure and function which are abnormal in PCD; and genetic studies to identify disease - causing mutations in genes associated with CF, PCD, and PHA.","Healthy volunteers and patients with diseases that involve problems clearing mucus from the lungs will be examined and tested to better understand the reasons for recurring lung infections in these patients and to try to develop better ways to diagnose and treat them. The study will also try to identify the genes responsible for these diseases.

Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older and patients 2 years of age or older with suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF) or pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) may be eligible for this study. Patients enrolled in the Natural History Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria at NIH or other NIH natural history protocols may also be enrolled. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during a 1-day visit at the NIH Clinical Center, as follows:

All patients and normal volunteers have the following procedures:

Physical examination and review of medical and genetic history and family genetic history.
Lung function test and measurement of oxygen saturation level.
Nitric oxide measurement to measure the amount of nitric oxide production in the nose: A small tube is placed in the nose while the subject breathes through the mouth into a cardboard tube.

All patients have the following additional procedures:

Blood tests for liver and kidney function, blood count, immunoglobulins and pregnancy test (where appropriate).
Blood test or buccal scrape (brushing the inside of the cheek) to obtain DNA to look for gene mutations that cause PCD, CF or PHA.
Scrape biopsy of cell lining the inside of the nose: A small toothpick-sized plastic stick with a tiny cup on the end is used to get nasal lining cells to look at the cilia (hair-like structures that move mucus).
Semen analysis (in some men) to test sperm tail function or structure.

Patients suspected of having a variant of CF or PHA, including nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, have the following additional procedures:

Sweat chloride test: A medicine is placed on the arm to produce sweat; then, a very low level of electric current is applied for 5 to 12 minutes. Sweat is collected in a plastic tube and tested for salt content.
Blood draw for CF genetic testing, if necessary, and to measure levels of the enzyme trypsin.
Saliva collection to measure sodium and chloride content.
Nasal potential difference to measure the electrical activity of the cells lining the inside of the nose: A soft plastic tube filled with a salt solution is passed into the nasal passage and a sterile needle is placed under the skin of the arm. This test provides information about how the lining of the nose is able to get used to changes in temperature and humidity. (Normal volunteers also have this test.)"

Not yet recruiting,January 2019,75 Years,6 Years,Anticipated,56,"Rhabdomyolysis is a poorly known symptom associated with the destruction of skeletal muscle cells. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolyses is carried when the dosage of muscle enzymes, in particular creatine phosphate kinase (KPC), is greater than 1000 U/L (normal < 160 U/L).

Rhabdomyolyses may be of viral origin, but fever and viruses are also triggers of genetic diseases. Also, the incidence of genetic rhabdomyolyses, representing 10 to 15% of all rhabdomyolyses, is underestimated. Genetic causes are heterogeneous. They are mainly attributed to hereditary diseases of metabolism, in particular fatty acid oxidation defects, Lipin-1 deficiency, muscle glycogenoses, TANGO2 deficiency, mitochondrial cytopathies and calcium channels anomalies of in particular RYR1.

Whatever the cause, traumatic, infectious or genetic, the rhabdomyolyses cause an alteration of the metabolism of adenosine triphosphate and a deregulation of the ionic channels, with the consequences of an intracytoplasmic calcium release and the destruction of muscle cells.

The prognosis of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism is poor and treatments are only symptomatic. Rhabdomyolysis outbreaks are frequently precipitated by fever and fasting. They are unpredictable. In spite of the care of patient in an intensive care unit, the occurrence of renal failure and heart rhythm disorders explains a significant acute-phase mortality rate. There is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism, in order to identify specific treatments.

The pathophysiological mechanism of rhabdomyolyses related to Lipin-1 deficiency has been identified. Two patients with Lipin-1 deficiency treated in vivo by Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil ®, 6 mg/kg/day by one oral intake) rapidly standardized their serum inflammatory profile and corrected their clinical phenotype: Plasma creatine phosphokinase levels, Amount of mitochondrial DNA in plasma, number of myolyses, muscular pain, quality of life. One of these two patients, suffering from cardiac dysfunction already reported in Lipin-1 deficiency (left ventricular ejection fraction or LVEF 45%), significantly and durably improved cardiac function after one month of treatment (LVEF 62%). In addition, his fatigability and sleep disturbances have dramatically improved.

Disruption of mitophagy and immunity could be a common denominator for rhabdomyolyses linked to hereditary diseases of metabolism, which could, despite their heterogeneity, benefit from a common therapeutic approach, Now non-existent. There could be a role of inflammation in rhabdomyolyses outbreaks of metabolic origin and new therapeutic approaches could be imagined as in the Lipin-1 deficiency.

Patients with rhabdomyolyses have few clinical signs outside of access. So there is a methodological difficulty in following a treatment test. There is an urgency to identify follow-up parameters in anticipation of new therapies.

In the Lipin deficiency, an anomaly of the effort tests with measurement of oxygen consumption and cardiac output was characterized. These effort tests were carried out in the context of care, in order to recognize for a given patient whether the practice of sport is a factor triggering rhabdomyolysis.

The objective of this study is to validate the hypothesis that effort test and cardiac function parameters are usable in the treatment monitoring for patients with acute rhabdomyolysis linked to a hereditary disease of metabolism and thus propose the effort test as an assessment tool for future clinical trials. To date, no tests are available for clinical trials. In order to do so, the correlation between the results of the effort tests, performed to each patient with rhabdomyolysis related to a hereditary disease of metabolism, with the severity of the disease will be assessed, including:

1) Metabolic flux on myoblasts, 2) clinical severity (onset of disease, number of rhabdomyolyses, cardiomyopathy), 3) genotype.

This study is original because it opens up innovative prospects for monitoring in the field of hereditary diseases of metabolism, with the identification of new monitoring tools.","The prognosis of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism is poor and treatments are only symptomatic.

Enrolling by invitation,"August 15, 2019",85 Years,4 Years,Actual,161,"This protocol is a retrospective review of donor search results for patients with inherited immunodeficiency diseases requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo HSCT).

The study will involve collecting information related to the donor search for transplant candidates and their prospective donors, using records in CRIS, Crimson, the HLA lab, and records in the transplant coordinator office (such as shipping logs of HLA typing kits). The study will not involve the use of specimens or participant contact.

The participants whose records will be reviewed will be those who were evaluated for allo HSCT or donation on an NIH primary immunodeficiency transplant protocol at a time when haplo donors were eligible (March 30, 2012 to present for GATA2, January 1, 2015 for CGD, October 6, 2015 to present for 16-C-0003, and May 21, 2014 to present for DOCK8).

The Principal Investigators on the included protocols have granted permission to conduct this study and have verified that none of the original protocols or informed consent documents preclude such a review of clinical data.","Background:

People who have certain immune system diseases often need a procedure called allo HSCT. This is short for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This might cure people with these diseases. Many people who need allo HSCT need donors who are relatives with similar genes. But the disease may also affect those in the donor pool. This may mean there are fewer options for people with inherited diseases. Researchers want to collect data on how transplant candidates and their donors are found.

Objective:

To find out how genetic diseases and the ways they are inherited affect the breadth of options for allo HSCT donors.

Eligibility:

Records from studies that have already been done. These will be for people ages 4 and older who were evaluated for allo HSCT or to be donors.

Design:

Participants already signed a consent form for their records to be shared.

Researchers will study the participant data.

Data will be stored in an electronic system. Researchers will use passwords to protect the data."
Unknown status,October 2005,,6 Months,Anticipated,200,"It is proposed to identify and recruit individuals and/or families with specified the disorders listed above. 10-20 ml (2-4 teaspoons) of peripheral blood will be collect¬ed from all adult subjects. Smaller volumes of blood would be collected from children based on their age/size. In some cases, as an adequate alternative to collecting peripheral blood, buccal cells will be collected using cheek swabs (Epicentre Biotechnologies). All relevant living members of each pedigree will be asked to partici¬pate, free of charge, on a research basis only. Genomic DNA will be extracted by standard methods and used as template for Polymerase Chain Reac¬tion (PCR) amplification reactions. Individuals will be genotyped at markers and candidate gene sequenced.

Essentially two approaches will be used:

Circumstances that may provide knowledge of candidate genes include reviews of the literature, biology of the disease, understanding of biological pathways, chromosomal rearrangements, mutants in model organisms etc. When candidate genes exist, it is proposed to use linked microsatellite and/or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PCR primer pairs on the DNA from families to determine if there is co-segregation of the disease and markers and thus linkage between the disease gene and previously mapped markers.

If the disease appears to be linked to the candidate gene, PCR primers flanking all coding exons will be used to amplify the exons and intron/exon boundaries followed by sequencing to detect disease-causing mutations. A web site that enables the design of primers to amplify candidate gene exons is available (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway ). If a very strong candidate gene exists, candidate gene sequencing will be performed on affected individual samples without first performing a linkage study.

When no obvious candidate genes exist, and a family of sufficient size has been collected, it is proposed to use Affymetrix SNP microarrays to perform a human genome-wide search for linkage. We have used this approach successfully before (Shrimpton et al 2004), utilizing the whole genome linkage analysis with the Human Mapping 10K Array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The 10K Array permits the simultaneous genotyping of more than 11,200 mapped SNPs spaced throughout the human genome at 210 KB intervals. Affymetrix 100K and 500K arrays are also available. SNP genotype information will be analyzed using Varia (Silicon Genetics) and/or Merlin software. The data will be used to define a critical region. If statistically significant segregation is detected, candidate genes within the critical region will be evaluated and ranked in order of their likelihood of being the disease gene. Candidate genes will then be sequenced as detailed above.

Summary.

Identify candidate disease genes from linkage studies, strong circumstantial evidence or clues from the phenotype.
Sequence candidate genes to detect disease-causing mutations.
Evaluation of detected variation.","This is a a study to identify inherited disease genes. The study will use molecular techniques to map genetic diseases using techniques such as Affymetrix SNP chips. The powerful combination of the information generated by the Human Genome Project and technical advances such as microarrays enables attempts to identify genes responsible for inherited disorders more possible than ever before. Starting with even modest pedigrees of only a few individuals, or even single individuals, it is possible to identify the gene(s) involved.

Not yet recruiting,"January 17, 2019",75 Years,18 Years,Anticipated,50,"Heart failure (HF) is a continuously growing public health problem. Presently, almost 40 million people are affected by heart failure worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are number one cause of deaths globally . In developed countries, the prevalence of heart failure is approximately 1-2% of the adult population. In Egypt, the prevalence of HF with preserved ejection fraction represents about 34.2 % while heart failure with reduced ejection fraction represents 65.8 % of total heart failure cases .

A broad range of cardiac diseases, inherited disorders, and systematic diseases can result in heart failure. The situation is even more complex, as heart failure can have mixed etiologies. Heart failure itself represents a ﬁnal common pathway in response to genetic and/or environmental inﬂuences. A clear genetic identification can positively influence patient treatment and, thereby, improve prognosis. Besides, understanding the pathogenesis of genetically induced heart failure at it molecular level may lead to the development of specific individual heart failure therapies in the future.

The human heart uses large amounts of amino acids (AAs) as regulators of both myocardium protein turnover and energy metabolism, but uses few AAs as substrates for direct energy production .The heart's reliance on AAs increases during heart failure because of high myocardium anabolic activity and cardiomyocyte energy shortage. Anabolic activity of the ventricle wall is induced by both high levels of ventricular pressure and a myocardial substrate shift from fatty acid oxidation (FAOX) to glucose oxidation (GLUOX).

Various mechanisms may potentially be operating during CHF to impair arterial AAs, including inadequate protein-energy intake, body AA overconsumption, particularly in hyper metabolic states, increased remodeling activity of the heart and lung and ﬁnally, the development of pathogenic gut ﬂora. Understanding arterial AA levels could be useful to understand whether heart anabolic activity and remaining heart capacity of energy production are being threatened by low AA s and furthermore may allow us to correct altered AAs through diet and/or supplementation of speciﬁc free AAs.

A reduction in essential AAs in CHF subjects, shows the disease severity-related decline of arterial levels of those non-essential (and essential methionine) AAs with the greatest impact on myocardium energetics, anti-oxidative capacity and myocardial protein remodeling.

Calcium cycling protein and heart failure Ca2+-dependent signaling is highly regulated in cardiomyocytes and determines the force of cardiac muscle contraction. Ca2+ cycling refers to the release and reuptake of intracellular Ca2+ that drives muscle contraction and relaxation in failing hearts. Ca2+ cycling is profoundly altered, resulting in impaired contractility and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The key defects in Ca2+ cycling occur at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a Ca2+ storage organelle in muscle. Defects in the regulation of Ca2+ cycling proteins including the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) a cardiac Ca2+ release channel macromolecular complexes and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase2a (SERCA2a) contribute to heart failure.

Phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) phospho-site S2808 has hallmark of heart failure (HF) and a critical mediator of the physiological fight or flight response of the heart. In support of this hypothesis, mice unable to undergo phosphorylation at RyR2-S2808 (S2808A) were significantly protected against HF and displayed a blunted response to adrenergic stimulation.","Heart failure (HF) is a continuously growing public health problem. The study aim to provide novel insights into the role of amino acids in pathogenesis of heart failure, to obtain a better understanding of cardiac ryanodine Receptor 2 role as an essential player in excitation-contraction coupling in pathogenesis of heart failure and clarify the potential value of these markers as targets for heart failure therapy"
Completed,May 2006,,,Actual,367,"Two types of genetic diseases are associated with abnormal mucociliary clearance. The first type results in defective ciliary function and includes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as Kartagener Syndrome. The second type results in defective ion transportation and includes variant cystic fibrosis (CF) and pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). The clinical manifestations of these three diseases overlap, and current evaluation procedures are inadequate for an accurate and timely diagnosis. A delayed diagnosis, coupled with poorly defined disease categories, results in sub-optimal treatment regimens. The purpose of this study is to better define the clinical and genetic features of PCD, variant CF, and PHA to develop improved diagnostic procedures. The study will also compare prevalence and age-related information among the three diseases and classic CF. Outcomes of this study may lead to improved clinical care and novel therapeutic approaches for rare genetic disorders of the airways.

Prior to study entry, previous clinical data on all participants will be reviewed to ensure that individuals do not have common variants of asthma. In some cases, further clinical evaluation (sweat chloride testing, immunodeficiency testing, and a high-resolution computed tomography scan) may be recommended. Eligible participants will attend an initial six-hour study visit similar to a standard diagnostic evaluation. The participant's medical history will be reviewed and a physical examination will include height, weight, and vital sign measurements. Respiratory cultures, nasal samples, and blood will be collected. Non-invasive techniques will be used to measure oxyhemoglobin saturation levels and airflow; a chest x-ray will be required if none has been done in the last six months.

Salivary and semen samples may be collected from some individuals. A sweat chloride test and nasal potential difference test may also be performed.","Mucociliary clearance, in which mucus secretions are cleared from the breathing airways, is the primary defense mechanism for the lungs. Inhaled particles, including microbes that can cause infections, are normally entrapped in mucus on the airway surfaces and then cleared out by the coordinated action of tiny hair-like structures called cilia. Individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia, variant cystic fibrosis, and pseudohypoaldosteronism have defective mucociliary clearance.

The RDCRN consortium sites for AS, RTT and PWS will participate in the study. These sites will recruit study participants, obtain informed consent and administer the sleep questionnaires. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained at each RDCRN consortium site.

""Subjects"" is defined as those children with a diagnosis of AS, PWS, and RTT. Subjects will be divided into separate study arms based upon their medical diagnosis. Study arms will consist of: 1) AS group, 2) PWS group, 3) RTT group, and 4) control group. ""Control group"" is defined as normal healthy siblings of subjects.

Study participants and parents/guardians will be asked to complete the study questionnaires during the clinic visit. The questionnaires are brief and should not be difficult to complete. It is anticipated that the questionnaires can be completed in 15-30 minutes. If parents are unable to complete the questionnaires at the time of their scheduled clinic visit they will be asked to take the questionnaires home to complete and to mail them back to the research team. When the research team receives the returned questionnaires they will be reviewed for completion. If questions are skipped or left blank, a member of the research team will call the family to complete the missed questions over the phone.

"Active, not recruiting","February 22, 2019",,6 Years,Anticipated,8,"Main and secondary objectives :

The main objective is to study the pathological role of ML mutations in KS to facilitate the identification and characterization of therapeutic strategies to improve the symptoms of patients with KS. Due to the lack of treatment in the KS, the aim is to develop a model of this disease from fibroblasts from patients and reprogram them into mesenchymal stem cells. This approach will generate a KS-specific stem cell bio-bank, allowing the identification of common disturbances caused by the loss of function (LoF) of KMT2D. The impact of the KMT2D LoF on transcription but also the epigenetic mechanisms activated during MSC differentiation will be described. Finally, the therapeutic potential of an epigenome ""editing"" approach to increase the expression of the wild KMT2D allele to restore the functional activity of MLL4 in treated MSCs will be evaluated.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the ability to return to normal after CRISPR/Case9 gene therapy treatment on patients' cells

Methodology (design study, population, description of groups (if applicable), inclusion criteria, non-inclusion, main and secondary judgment criteria, number of subjects to be included, statistical analysis...) :

Starting from primary cells isolated from affected patients, an in vitro model of the disease will be developed. An integrative but alternative strategy approach to obtain mesenchymal stem cells derived from patients to define normal and abnormal transcription and epigenetic circuits during KMT2D LoF will be adopted. By combining the autonomous renewal potential of MSCs with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an approach to ""editing"" the epigenome for therapeutic purposes to restore MLL4 activity will be developed.

This project will represent a step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for KS. The in vitro model will provide the scientific community with an experimental system to study KS. Finally, the aim is to define the molecular basis of KS and develop a therapeutic strategy to improve certain symptoms in patients with KS.

Process (number of visits, duration of inclusions, duration of follow-up):

8 people will be included: 4 patients with Kabuki syndrome authenticated by the molecular genetics study of the KMT2D gene.

4 parents of the same sex as the patient

Feasibility :

In the clinical genetics department of the Montpellier University Hospital, more than 40 patients with Kabuki syndrome are followed.

Impacts / prospects :

The identification of the consequences of mutations in the KMT2D gene on epigenetic mark changes and cellular structural changes as well as the attempt at gene correction by CRISPR/Cas9 will provide a better understanding of the disease (and the genes that are deregulated by post-KMT2D epigenetic changes) and will also open a promising path for gene therapy by CRISPR/Cas9 method.","Starting from isolating primary cells from affected patients, an in vitro disease model system for KS will be developed. Using alternative strategies to obtain patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells, an integrative approach will be adopted for defining both the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks perturbed upon the loss of function of KMT2D. Combining the self-renewal potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, an epigenome editing approach as therapeutic strategy to rescue the activity of MLL4 will be developed.

A step forward is expected towards the understanding of those the molecular mechanisms governing the aetiology of Kabuki Syndrome (KS) and that the proposed in vitro disease model will provide to the scientific community an experimental system to study the KS. Importantly, the aim is to define the molecular bases of KS and to develop a therapeutic strategy that could ameliorate some of the abnormalities associated with KS."
Recruiting,July 2016,,,Anticipated,102000,"RCI will collect biological samples (such as blood), derived genomic sequences (from DNA and RNA), and clinical features in a Biorepository as a standardized resource for future research studies. The purpose of the Genomics Institute Biorepository is to provide consented samples and data for basic and clinical research related to the genomic cause and treatment of childhood disease, and, in the future, as reference (Quality Control) data to improve the ability to make clinical diagnoses or clinical decision.

A diverse Biorepository of biological samples and clinical data is essential to allow these studies to undertake broad and detailed comparisons. In particular, a large Biorepository will allow Institute-affiliated researchers to identify new causes of diseases or treatment responses in many of the understudied ethnic and racial groups that Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego (RCHSD) serves.

Specifically, the Biorepository, via subsequent individual research protocols, will enable research to improve rates of clinical diagnoses for enrolled subjects and subsequently all affected patients, improve testing capabilities offered to patients, enhance understanding of the mechanisms of disease and treatment responses, and improve clinical management of these diseases. The Biorepository will enroll affected and unaffected individuals and family members, or affected and unaffected tissues, for the purposes of analysis and comparison in order to identify the underlying cause of the disease or treatment in the affected samples. Samples and data will be stored indefinitely and shared with approved researchers to further understanding of genomic components of pediatric diseases.

In addition, the Biorepository will provide a mechanism for making a diagnosis of a genetic disease. That is, once genomic sequences have been derived from biological samples, they will be immediately analyzed. If a genetic disease is identified that appears to explain an affected child's clinical features, then those results will be confirmed in a manner that is compliant with the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CLIA) and College of American Pathologist (CAP) recommendations, and placed in the electronic health record (EHR). Samples confirmed by CLIA and CAP methods will be identified as such and retained for future confirmatory investigations.

Specific Aims

To create, analyze and store genomic data from the biological samples. Genomic data will include genome (DNA) sequences, RNA sequences, and/or other related 'omic data (including pharmacogenomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and the microbiome). Some genomic data will be whole genome sequences. For other samples the genomic data will be panels of specific genes or of all exons of genes (the ""Exome"").
To investigate and improve genomics technologies and software to enhance understanding and testing abilities related to childhood diseases and treatment responses.
To make specimens and data available for qualified researchers and collaborators to further the understanding of childhood diseases and treatment responses.
To collect and correlate genomic data from a wide variety of populations and clinical presentations.
To provide sample and data collections with uniform consent, methods of acquisition, storage for genome-based research studies with subsequent IRB approvals.
To analyze and report clinically-confirmed genomic diagnoses and treatment guidance through use of new research technologies.
To identify and study novel gene and disease processes.

The investigator will plan to enroll 3000 subjects per year. Following informed consent, the study team will collect a family history and blood samples. The investigator will collect clinical information from the medical record at the time of enrollment and longitudinally to assess changes in the subject's medical condition as well as collect new symptoms. The study team will scavenge tissue and other biological materials obtained from clinical procedures as indicated by clinical presentation and for future research testing.","Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine (RCI) will collect biological samples (such as blood), derived genomic sequences (from DNA and RNA), and clinical features in a Biorepository as a standardized resource for future research studies.

The study will involve up to 30 pairs of male and female sexually intimate partners who are carriers for a genetic disease (e.g Sickle Cell Disease or Thalassemia) and at high risk of transmitting the gene.

The female partner will be superovulated to mature multiple oocytes which can be fertilized, inseminated with her partner's sperm through intra-uterine insemination (IUI). Four to six days after IUI, the female partner will undergo a non-surgical uterine lavage procedure to recover preimplantation embryos.

Following lavage, a GnRH antagonist will be administered to cause lysis of multiple corpora lutea to mitigate risk of hyperstimulation from the use of fertility medication and reduce the risk of ectopic pregnancy should the lavage procedure not recover all preimplantation embryos.

Recovered preimplantation embryos may be screened for aneuploidy and genetic disease, then cryopreserved for potential future use by the subjects and the Investigator separate from the purpose of this study.

Mast cells are responsible for most symptoms of allergic reactions. In some allergic diseases, it is unusually easy to cause mast cells to release their contents and cause allergic reactions. In other cases, mast cells grow abnormally and, in rare cases, can result in tumors. Mast cells also control other parts of the immune system.
Understanding why mast cells behave abnormally in allergic diseases is important to finding better ways for diagnosing and treating these potentially life-threatening disorders.

Objectives:

To screen mast cells at the genetic and functional levels to characterize abnormalities, identify mutations, detect carrier states, and/or develop therapies for such disorders.
To create a library of information about inherited diseases of mast cell homeostasis and activation, including piebaldism (problems with skin and hair pigmentation), anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ), food allergies, urticaria/angioedema (hives/swelling), immunodeficiency diseases, and autoimmune diseases.

Eligibility:

Patients between the ages of 1 and 80 years who have been referred by a physician and are known to have or be suspected of having an inherited disorder of mast cells, in particular patients (and their relatives) with piebaldism, allergies, or anaphylaxis that is not caused by allergies.

Evaluation is limited to testing on blood specimens; no treatment will be provided.
Clinical and research laboratory evaluations of patients will include the following:
Clinical evaluation and previous laboratory tests as documented in outside medical records by health care providers. A standard questionnaire will also be administered at the time of subject enrollment.
Blood collection for clinical laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical evaluation where appropriate (5 ml).
Blood collection for research laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical evaluation including genetic screening and assessment of mast cell growth and functioning and storage of additional frozen blood specimens for future studies (up to an additional 30 ml).
Evaluations of blood relatives will include the following:
Clinical evaluation as documented from outside medical records by health care providers and administration of a standard questionnaire.
Blood collection where indicated for diagnostic or research purposes.
After 12 consecutive months on the study, results from initial evaluation will be reviewed. Subjects with findings deemed to be of continued interest will be contacted and invited to remain as active participants to this protocol for another year, provided that they renew their consent to participate."
Recruiting,"February 18, 2010",,1 Month,Anticipated,2000,"We aim to use whole-genome medical sequencing (WGMS) to discover causative molecular lesions for a set of rare, severe phenotypes hypothesized to be caused by either somatic mutations, germline de novo heterozygous mutations, germline inherited recessive, or germline inherited dominant mutations in currently unknown or uncharacterized genes. The goal of this research is threefold: to identify causative sequence variants for disorders whose molecular etiology was previously unknown, to apply this insight to both the rare disorders under study and more common phenotypes, and to enhance the study of mutation on a genome-wide level.

We plan to recruit approximately three to six affected individuals along with both parents for each phenotype under study. Prospectively recruited trios will be brought to the NIH Clinical Center for brief clinical evaluations and molecular evaluation. Each trio will be consented to whole genome sequencing with the option to learn clinically relevant results, that is, those that explain the disorder in question (what we refer to as the primary variant ) as well as other clinically relevant findings discovered incidentally as part of the WGMS process (what we refer to as secondary variants ). Participants will be offered a return visit to NIH to learn these results, and will be asked to complete surveys and participate in interviews related to their decisions about participation in the study and to learn individual genotype results.

The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) will screen for sequence variants that conform to the hypothesized inheritance pattern. These variants will be validated, for example by using trios for de novo phenotypes, or with additional cases. We have started developing analytic algorithms to distinguish potentially pathogenic genetic alterations from normal variation. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a CLIA-certified laboratory and the results returned to that participant, should they choose to learn these findings. This protocol is being designed in a way that will provide the long-term potential for pursuing many different clinical projects.","Background:

- A number of rare inherited diseases affect only a few patients, and the genetic causes of these conditions remain unknown. Researchers are studying the use of a new technology called whole genome sequencing to learn which gene or genes cause these conditions. Understanding the genes that cause these diseases is important to improve diagnosis and treatment of affected patients.

Objectives:

To identify the genetic cause of disorders that are difficult to identify with existing techniques.
To develop best practices for the medical and counseling challenges of whole genome sequencing.

Eligibility:

Individuals who have one of the rare disorders under consideration in this study. These conditions are generally those in which the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown. The eligibility of most individual participants will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the researchers.
Family members of affected individuals, if that family member (often a parent) may provide genetic information.

Design:

Participants in this study will have at least one and in some cases several of the following procedures:
A medical genetics evaluation.
Other tests that may include x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams, and consultations with other doctors. Not all studies are necessary for each person, but the information from the tests may be required to proceed with some of our gene sequencing studies.
Clinical photographs to document certain aspects of the disorder.
Blood and skin biopsy samples, or other tissue samples, as required by the study doctors.
Genetic testing, as decided by the researchers. However, most participants in this study can expect to undergo whole genome sequencing, which is a technique to study all of a person s genes.
Some participants may be asked to take part in a telephone interview and/or a web-based survey.
Participants will have choices about what kinds of results from whole genome sequencing they wish to learn.
After the tests have been completed and the results of the genetic studies are known, participants will be offered a return visit to the National Institutes of Health to learn these results.

Enrolling by invitation,"May 28, 2019",,,Anticipated,150,"1.0 Objectives

1.1 Study Objectives The goal of this research project is to assess the potential for applying whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a diagnostic tool in the neonatal intensive care unit. Newborn children who require treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often suffer from genetic defects, the nature of which is difficult to diagnose. The investigators currently know of more than 5000 genes in which mutations may cause diseases that can affect newborn children, so determining which one is responsible for a new neonatal patient's disease is daunting. However, many of these diseases can be effectively treated if they are diagnosed in a timely fashion. The investigators propose to use new sequencing instrumentation coupled with rapid analytical tools to sequence NICU patients along with both parents to identify whether a patient carries a de novo mutation or compound heterozygous variants in one of the known disease genes. If so, the mutation will be confirmed in an in-house CLIA laboratory and the results provided within 72 hours to attending neonatologists to inform treatment decisions.

1.2 Primary Study Endpoints

The primary goal of this protocol will be an assessment of the degree to which WGS improves diagnosis of patients admitted to the NICU. The investigators propose to perform sequencing on approximately 50 patients over the course of this project. The investigators will evaluate on an ongoing basis the success rate for identifying clinically actionable genetic defects in the selected patients, particularly as that would inform the initial selection criteria used to enroll the patient. This information will be useful to determine whether such sequencing efforts can improve the outcome of NICU patients and which class of patients are most likely to benefit from the procedure.

1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints

A second goal will be an assessment of the effectiveness of targeted sequencing of the whole exome or a panel of 5000 genes in identifying the genetic defects revealed by whole genome sequencing and the relative cost in money and time of the various approaches. This could yield a significantly more efficient and cost effect method over that currently described elsewhere.

Finally, the investigators propose to use the data to begin to develop a cost-benefit analysis of WGS in the NICU. The investigators will assess the extent to which WGS provided a diagnosis distinct from that initially proposed by the neonatologists and the extent to which that change in diagnosis altered the treatment regimen. If the novel diagnosis did, in fact, alter treatment, The investigators would use historical data to assess the degree to which that altered treatment affected the number of days the patient remained in the NICU. The investigators can then estimate the cost savings/loss as the number of NICU days saved times the cost per day of NICU residence versus the cost of performing the sequencing over the entire cohort of sequenced patients. While this is not as rigorous as a randomized clinical trial, it would point to whether this is a methodology worth exploring in more depth.","This research is being done to see if whole genome sequencing (WGS) improves the diagnosis of patients in the NICU. Using WGS in this way, which is relatively new, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine will look at approximately 5000 genes that are known to be associated with genetic diseases to see if the neonatal patient has a known disease causing mutation. Comparing the parents' DNA with the child's will help the investigators better understand the child's DNA."

Enrolling by invitation,"August 29, 2017",,,Anticipated,100000,"Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) is a new technology that is able to deliver symptom-driven diagnoses of childhood-onset genetic diseases in as little as 26 hours. Investigators at RCIGM have shown that rWGS has higher diagnostic rates than traditional molecular testing in acutely ill infants suspected of a genetic diagnosis, with diagnostic rates up to 57%. Similarly, in the infant population, RCIGM researchers have shown that these diagnoses are useful in directing clinical care, with up to 70% of infants who receive a diagnosis having a subsequent change in management. In some cases, a timely diagnosis results in treatments that are lifesaving. RCIGM investigators have shown that up to 25% of infants who receive a diagnosis have a subsequent change in management that prevents morbidity. More data is needed to determine whether these results are found at other institutions, among other ethnic and racial groups, and in larger numbers of patients. More data is needed to examine the acute and long-term clinical utility of such testing, both in newborns and older children, as well as to determine the cost-effectiveness of this testing for other institutions. As such, this study will be a collaboration of multiple sites to share data and experiences of rWGS with the scientific community as well as hospital administrations, insurance companies and other key stakeholders who may be interested in promoting rWGS as a first-line clinical test in the future.

The study will provide clinical laboratory-confirmed results related to the affected patient's symptoms, including optional incidental findings unless subjects opt-out for these additional results, to allow for these research findings to be used in clinical care. Furthermore, this study will aggregate data regarding standard clinical genetic testing from multiple sites as well as cost measures to not only identify differences in diagnostic rates, diagnostic accuracy, and times to diagnoses, but to determine the cost-effectiveness of this testing and subsequent changes in care management. Clinical utility will be defined as changes in care that follow directly from results of genetic testing (both positive and negative), including standard clinical tests and rWGS. This data will be used to further examine the analytic, diagnostic, and clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this testing.

rWGS methods continue to improve, and pediatric genomic medicine is a very new field of medical practice. This study will also inform investigators regarding best practices, both in terms of traditional medical outcomes and patient-centered outcomes. Consequently, this study will also act as a biorepository for samples and data as the ability to share genomic and phenotypic data amongst researchers is critical to progressing our understanding of the nascent field of pediatric genomic medicine.

Specimens will be processed for large-scale gene expression analysis and DNA copy number determination using DNA microarrays. The development and analysis of this gene expression and gene copy number database are the primary purpose of this study. Currently available and new bioinformatics tools will be applied to the data for the characterization of disease subsets (e.g., early vs. advanced stage cancer) as well as to mine the data for specific genes which are linked to given disease states.","This study will look at genetic changes which occur in the development of male and female breast cancer and other cancer. It will use a new technology called DNA microarray hybridization that looks at a wide array of genes to identify disease-associated patterns in the human genome (complete set of human genes). Numerous studies have linked particular genes to a given disease, but there is very little information on patterns of gene expression (production of proteins from genetic coding) in the entire human genome.

Pinpointing genetic abnormalities in disease may help classify different forms of cancer and perhaps lead to new avenues of treatment or prevention. A primary goal of this study will be to create a database of gene expression for human cancers and other disorders that will provide the basis for finding genetic abnormalities in disease.

Recruiting,"August 20, 2001",99 Years,,Anticipated,750,"Hereditary hearing impairment is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that can be caused by mutations in any one of hundreds of different genes. Approximately 20 genes have now been identified in which mutations can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The identification and analysis of these genes and their mutations are providing critical insights into the development, structure, and function of the auditory system, as well as the molecular mechanisms associated with disruption of these processes. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying familial disorders affecting peripheral vestibular function appear to be more rare, have not been well described, and are less well understood. The peripheral auditory and vestibular systems share many common features in both health and disease, and many hereditary hearing loss disorders also affect vestibular function. The purpose of this study is to identify genes and mutations causing hereditary disorders of hearing, balance, or both. Members of families segregating hereditary disorders of hearing or balance will be enrolled in the proposed study in order to: (1) define and characterize the phenotypes and natural histories; (2) identify the underlying causative mutations and genes by linkage, positional cloning, and/or candidate gene mutation analyses; (3) and correlate observed phenotypes with the corresponding mutations and functions of the underlying genes.","This study will try to identify the genetic causes of hereditary hearing loss or balance disorders.

Unknown status,February 2015,,18 Years,Anticipated,1000,"BACKGROUND

Molecular medicine is the branch of knowledge whose purpose is to elucidate the genetic basis of the diseases, to improve the diagnostic definition and prognostic assessment of patients and to contribute to the development of innovative treatments. Genomic information is increasingly being used in the treatment decision making process for individual patients. The clinical implementation of molecular medicine requires systematic approaches based on the integration of scientific, medical and technological expertises.

Hematological malignancies include leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The molecular basis of many hematological neoplasms are still unknown. At the present of researchers' knowledge, scientists know that hematological malignancies are mostly dynamic diseases that arise from a large series of primary and secondary biological and genetic events (i.e. driver and passenger mutations). The Identification of key molecular changes that drive tumour development and progression is essential for the development of new targeted and personalized therapies.

Hematological malignancies typically occur in elderly people and, as a result of population aging, represent a growing critical issue for health policies. Hematological malignancies are an ideal context for the implementation of molecular medicine. The paradigmatic example of this is chronic myeloid leukemia, in which the discovery of the molecular basis (the fusion gene BCR/ABL1) has been translated into major clinical advances in diagnosis, treatment and disease monitoring.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasm published in 2008 introduced many genetic changes in the diagnostic definition of blood cancers. Since 2008 plenty of genetic lesions have been identified in many hematological malignancies and the next WHO classification will include many of them.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques gave the best contribute to these findings.

NGS use high-technology tools that can sequence, in a short time and with relatively low costs, the whole genome or a specific part of it (e.g. exome or targeted genes). The advantage of NGS compared to standard sequencing consists in higher efficiency (a large amount of genes rapidly analysed in a large amount of samples) and higher sensitivity (capacity of detecting mutations in very small clones of neoplastic cells). In last years the availability of new technologies for genomic has enabled the high-throughput screening of somatic mutations in hematological malignancies. It is expected that the results of these studies will significantly improve the management of individual patients through the implementation of innovative diagnostic/prognostic systems and the development of therapeutic strategies based on individual genomic profile.

The Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and University of Pavia has significantly contributed to the definition of molecular basis of hematological malignancies. In 2005 the University of Pavia described the diagnostic and prognostic significance of the JAK2 V617F mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): this mutation was included into the WHO classification of MPN and innovative anti-JAK2 drugs were developed. In 2010, the University of Pavia joined the Cancer Genome Project, a consortium of international research Centers coordinated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute of Cambridge with the aim to elucidate the molecular basis of cancer. In this context, by using massive genome sequencing, recurrent mutations in SF3B1 gene - that encode for a core component of RNA splicing machinery - were described in myelodysplastic syndromes.

Moreover in last years, researchers from the University of Pavia gave a significant contribution in the definition of the molecular basis of lymphoid neoplasms (i.e., BRAF V600E mutation in Hairy cell Leukemia, MYD88 L265P mutation in Waldenstrom disease, and SF3B1 mutations in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia). Finally, in the very last months the Universisty of Pavia had a key role in the identification of CALR mutations in JAK2-negative MPN. This is again an important finding in the comprehension of the genetic basis of this groups of diseases.

In addition to the implementation of next-generation techniques (NGS) for genomic analysis, there is clearly a need to develop effective solutions to analyze and integrate molecular and clinical data of large patient populations, in order to fully understand the relationship between genotype and the clinical expression of a disease.

The implementation of molecular medicine requires systematic approaches based on the integration of scientific, clinical and technological expertise. In Italy, the ideal context for the development of molecular medicine programs is represented by hematological regional networks. They represent an innovative model of organization and collaboration, based on the networking of health care facilities. The Rete Ematologica Lombarda (REL, www.rel-lombardia.net) brings together 11 hematological referral centres and has recently provided the basis for a systematic study of these diseases. The strategic objective of REL clinical network is to ensure the better access to the health care facilities, the high quality of services and the continuity of care for all the hematological patients.

REL clinical network can give a crucial contribute on the translational research on hematological malignancies and recently, with this purpose, the Regione Lombardia in January 2014 financed a biotechnology cluster for the implementation of genomic analysis and the development of new treatments for hematological diseases. The REL biotechnology cluster (www.relab-lombardia.net) involves the Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo, the University of Pavia, the biotech company Clonit (www.clonit.it) and the pharmaceutical company Novartis. This cluster aims to investigate the molecular basis of hematological malignancies and to develop personalized treatments.

GENERAL POURPOSE of the STUDY

In this study, the Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia in collaboration with the University of Pavia and the IRCCS Fondazione Maugeri, Pavia will provide a systematic analysis of gene mutations in hematological malignancies by using NGS techniques.

Patients with a conclusive diagnosis of haematological malignancies according to WHO criteria referred to the REL clinical network will be enrolled. The researchers will analyse genomic DNA and RNA extracted from hematopoietic cells at different time points of patient disease. The study contemplates the use of two optimized molecular platforms aimed at the identification of recurrent mutations in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, respectively.

Screening of gene mutations by NGS will be prospectively implemented in the context of REL clinical network. Patient samples will be analyzed at diagnosis and sequentially during the course of the disease at specific timepoints.

The investigators will analyze the correlations between somatic mutations, specific clinical phenotypes (according to the WHO classification) and disease evolution. This will allow to: 1) identify new recurrent genetic mutations involved in the molecular pathogenesis of hematological malignancies; 2) define the role of mutated genes, distinguishing between genes which induce a clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, and genes which determine the clinical phenotype of the disease; 3) identify mutations which are responsible for disease evolution; 4) define the diagnostic/prognostic role of the identified mutations, and update the current disease classifications and prognostic scores by including molecular parameters.

A systematic biobanking of biological material will be provided.

7. STUDY DESIGN :

This is a multicentric, prospective, observational study. All patients with a diagnosis of hematological malignancy according to WHO classification performed within REL clinical network are intended to be enrolled.

8. ASPECTS OF GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE, DATA PRIVACY

Biobanking is governed under the general regulatory framework for biomedical research. This is a mosaic of formal legal instruments and regulatory bodies put in place at national and European levels, as well as more informal types of governance tools and instruments such as professional guidelines and best practice. Regulation of biomedical research consists of binding and non-binding legal instruments at both national and European levels. This is in the form of specific law for medical research - for example the Council of Europe Oviedo Convention 1997 - and more general legal instruments - such as human rights and data protection law - some of which have relevance for biobanking. Responsibility for the oversight of research and ensuring compliance with the legal requirements has largely been delegated to national bodies, such as research ethics committees.

8.1 DATA COLLECTION

The study contemplate the collection of clinical and biological indispensable data for a precise diagnostic and prognostic standard definition in a ad-hoc electronic CRF and the analysis of specific genes that can be involved in the molecular basis of the diseases through a NGS techniques.

8.2 CLINICAL DATA WAREHOUSE (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, I2B2)

Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2, www.i2b2.org) is an open source clinical data warehouse, which is efficiently interrogated to find sets of interesting patients preserving their privacy through a query tool interface. Within this architecture, interoperable server-side software objects, called ""cells"", are able to exchange information with each other, relying on web services technology.

In order to support and improve the efficiency of clinical research in oncology, the University of Pavia and the IRCCS Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri of Pavia developed and implemented a novel ICT platform, called Onco-i2b2, grounded on the i2b2 software and installed in the IRCCS Fondazione S. Maugeri, Pavia. Onco-i2b2 is able to integrate data from different sources inside the i2b2 data warehouse through the implementation of a complex IT architecture, which includes development of new i2b2-cells for data analysis.

As result of this project, hospital researchers have been enabled to obtain information from the pathology database, from a biobank management system and to merge them with the clinical information present in the hospital information system, in order to select interesting patients with a specific phenotype of interest.

8.3 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF PSEUDONYMIZATION PROCESS AND USED TOOLS

Actually a specific regulation at national level for technical aspects relate to biobank does not exist, but some workgroups of experts (e.g. AIOM e SIAPEC-IAP) have raised up initiatives for defining and harmonizing the existing national general procedures. A brief list of structural and technological requirements can be identified in:

Definition of a programmatic documentation with objective of the biobank, a functional specifications to be performed, the type of the preserved material, number of expected specimens, methods of drawdown, processing and conservation, management of information, specimens transport and reception from the receiving unit, management of the possible biological risk and an economic plan for medium-large period
Logical definition of the dedicated locals, conditioning systems and access control. In addiction temperature of the cryo-containers have to be monitored continuously.
Disaster recovery plan for equipment and cryo containers has to be defined (e.g. use of systems for electrical continuity or list of competent staff that should intervene when special events occur)
Use of a certified quality system for each step of the different procedures is recommended, keeping track of data quality from the acquisition of the informed consent to the storage of the specimen
Definition of a dedicated information system for managing the biobank samples , related to clinical information stored in the hospital information system, to track the specimen movements and update the follow-up data deriving by the scientific research performed.
Disaster recovery plan also for the IT architecture has to be implemented. It consists in an incremental backup of all biobank data that allows the IT system managers to restore all the information in any period of time In the ""Bruno Boerci"" oncologic biobank each biological specimen is identified by a specific code, printed on the tube using a data matrix barcode (a bi-dimensional bar code readable through the use of a laser scanner), and stored in the biobank database and managed by the biobank management software, that allows also to view its position inside the biobank cryo container. Clinical data for each follow up are collected automatically retrieving data from the hospital information system. Clinical data and biobank information are constantly and continually inserted in clinical data warehouse by an automatic update procedure. Clinical and pathological data are codified using SNOMED, TNM and ICD9-CM standards. The use of the BRISQ system for data standardization (Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality, Biopreservation and Biobanking, 2011) is recommended, but not implemented yet.

8.4 TRANSFER OF PATIENTS SAMPLES AND BIOBANK SAMPLES ENTRANCE

Bio specimens anonymisation (or better, de-identification) has to be performed in to assure high levels of data privacy. The terminology used in the European documents identifies the term 'anonymized' when biological material is stored alongside associated information, such as the type of tumour, medical treatment, donor's age and so forth, but all information that would allow identification of the research participant or patient is stripped, either irreversibly (unlinked anonymized) or reversibly (linked anonymized). In the case of linked anonymized samples, identification is possible by a code, to which researchers or other users of the material—as part of the definition of the term 'reversibly/linked anonymized'—do not have access. Coded samples have the same characteristics as linked (reversibly) anonymized samples, the only difference being that researchers and users have access to the code.

In this project the use of coded-anonymisation is preferred in order to have an adequate level of privacy security and feasibility of research activities.

The proposed architecture that will implement this type of de -identification requires the definition of a code that identifies the bio specimen from the beginning and a second code that will be generated before the specimen will be stored in the biobank. A third code will automatically generated during the acceptance phase of the specimen and will be stored in a separate location. In this way the information related to the first code and those related to the final one are totally decoupled, unless the third code is known: this happens only when researchers need to access to both data concurrently.

9 MOLECOLAR ANALYSIS

The molecular analysis is performed by using 2 different NGS platforms for the target-resequencing. The platforms are outlined on the basis of the most recent literature on the molecular biology of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasm. It is noteworthy that the efforts of the scientific community in this area are huge, and this contributes to a continuous flow of new information and discoveries, with the consequent possibility of modifying the platforms.","In this prospective multicentric study, the University of Pavia together with the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia and the IRCCS Fondazione Maugeri, Pavia, Italy will provide a systematic analysis of gene mutations in hematological malignancies by using NGS techniques. Patients with a conclusive diagnosis of haematological malignancies according to WHO criteria referred to the Rete Ematologica Lombarda clinical network (REL, www.rel-lombardia.net) will be enrolled. The investigators will analyse genomic DNA extracted from hematopoietic cells at different time points of patient disease. The study contemplates the use of molecular platforms (Next Generation Sequencing, NGS) aimed at the identification of recurrent mutations in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, respectively. Screening of gene mutations by NGS will be prospectively implemented in the context of REL clinical network. Patient samples will be analyzed at diagnosis and sequentially during the course of the disease at specific timepoints. The researchers will analyze the correlations between somatic mutations, specific clinical phenotypes (according to the WHO classification) and disease evolution. This will allow to: 1) identify new recurrent genetic mutations involved in the molecular pathogenesis of hematological malignancies; 2) define the role of mutated genes, distinguishing between genes which induce a clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, and genes which determine the clinical phenotype of the disease; 3) identify mutations which are responsible for disease evolution; 4) define the diagnostic/prognostic role of the identified mutations, and update the current disease classifications and prognostic scores by including molecular parameters. A systematic biobanking of biological material will be provided."
Completed,October 2014,4 Months,,Actual,65,"This is a randomized, blinded, prospective study examining the comparative effectiveness - both clinical and cost effectiveness - of rapid NGS (StatSeq), compared to standard of care, including an expanded newborn screen, in acutely ill neonates and infants with potential genetic diseases. Acutely ill neonates and infants who have an undiagnosed illness, and their families, will be eligible to participate in the study. The investigators will enroll approximately 1,000 neonates and infants at a single study site. The study population will be recruited from Children's Mercy Hospital inpatient population, primarily the intensive care nursery (ICN, also known as the NICU), with a smaller subpopulation presenting to other hospital services, such as the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). All affected study participants will receive an expanded newborn screen (NBS). Newborn screening is biochemical testing of a heel-prick blood spot that is federally mandated to be performed on all US live births. 67 diseases are tested for by NBS in MO, most of which are genetic diseases. The expanded NBS proposed herein is the clinically available StepOne Newborn Screen® from Perkin Elmer, and will be performed in addition to standard State of MO screening on all enrolled infants in both arms. Half of the affected study participants will be randomized to receive StatSeq in addition to standard testing for their acute illness and expanded NBS. Additionally, all willing clinical providers will be enrolled and their perceptions on clinical outcomes will be measured.

All subjects will have blood drawn for nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) isolation and the expanded NBS at the time of enrollment in the study. All blood sample volumes will adhere to the CMH policy on maximum blood in pediatric patients. If the volume allowed for in this policy exceeds 5ml, 5 ml will be the maximum collected at enrollment. Buccal smears, heel-prick blood spots, additional blood, urine and tissue samples may be collected, if available as sample retains from other studies, and stored in the Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine (CPGM) per their approved IRB protocol (IRB Study #11120514). The latter samples will not involve invasive sampling. Nucleic acids will be isolated and prepared for NGS with standard protocols at the CPGM (Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine). Familial samples (for example, mother, father, affected or unaffected siblings) will also be obtained, and nucleic acids will also be sequenced per the Genome Center Biorepository protocol, as indicated, to assist in diagnosis of the acute medical condition in the newborn. All sequencing data will be stored in the Genome Center Biorepository (IRB Study #11120514).

A minimum of two expert Center data analysts will be responsible for analyzing the DNA variants following NGS. One of the analysts will then compile a report to be presented to the Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director or Assistant Director. In the case of positive study findings that may be diagnostic, the Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director or Assistant Director will perform confirmatory clinical diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, a standard clinical diagnostic report will be placed in the patient's medical record. In the case of acutely material (actionable) positive study findings, the results will be verbally conveyed to the primary clinical team directly prior to confirmatory testing. A generic research note will be placed in the patient's medical record that indicates that a verbal, provisional report was issued (Appendix A). Verbal, provisional reporting of results before confirmatory testing will only be performed in cases where the delay in reporting necessary for confirmation was likely to result in significant harm to the patient. Confirmatory testing will be performed promptly in all cases, including those in which in which a verbal report has been given. A case conference format may be utilized for return of results if the complexity of the diagnosis or potential treatment for that diagnosis warrants detailed discussion. If no potentially pathogenic variants are identified, a verbal report will be provided to the clinical care physician of record to communicate that there were no causative findings, and a generic research note will be placed in the medical record that states that nondiagnostic research grade NGS was performed (Appendix B). No negative diagnostic written report of results will be placed in the patient's chart in this instance, as there is no available clinical grade testing to confirm negative results for all genes tested. Follow up with the patient's family will be guided by the clinical care team. All study participants and their clinicians will be notified of randomization assignment at/by day 10 after randomization. This information will help alleviate anxiety on the part of the family, and also provides a mechanism for patient crossover into the rapid NGS arm if the patient is clinically deteriorating, and at the clinical care team's request. Rarely, those participants and clinicians will be notified sooner if they were randomized to the rapid NGS group and a diagnosis is made in less than 10 days. Both molecular diagnoses made and time to diagnosis will be recorded as primary outcomes.

All positive results from the Perkin Elmer StepOne expanded NBS (received by all enrolled infants and NOT a study variable) will be returned to the Genome Center personnel. Based on these results, confirmatory testing through Perkin Elmer will be performed if this condition was not identified on the standard State NBS screen for each infant. These provisional results will be verbally communicated with the primary clinician team and additional samples requested, if necessary, for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the results will be entered in the patient's medical record.

Each time a study participant is enrolled, the primary clinical providers will be asked to fill out a survey prior to StatSeq testing and after return of results. We will also review the patient's medical record and collect clinical variables including laboratory testing, radiology results, medications and other treatments received to further analyze the effect rapid NGS has on clinical care. We plan to follow up with families annually up to 5 years post enrollment and record clinical outcomes related to this study.

This study will be integrated with two other study protocols, one being the CMH Genomic Medicine Repository (IRB 11120514) and the other Genomes in newborns (#13120442) that studies the ethical and legal implications of rapid NGS in this population. Data records will be requested from both studies. The participants must agree to enroll in the Genome Center Biorepository. The Genomes in newborns study will be optional.","The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of rapid next generation sequencing (NGS, such as whole genome sequencing1) with current practice to provide diagnostic or prognostic information or treatment guidance in acutely ill neonates and infants, particularly with respect to clinical care, cost and outcomes."

Terminated,February 2007,,3 Months,Actual,20,"The present study is to evaluate de-escalation of the cyclophosphamide (CY) dose in an innovative conditioning regimen with fludarabine and alemtuzumab as additional agents to achieve immunoablation, in combination with Busulfan (BU) to achieve myeloablation. Replacement of at least part of the cyclophosphamide dose by fludarabine in the conditioning regimen would be expected to maintain immunosuppression (and, therefore, engraftment) while reducing transplant-related complications (mucositis, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis, mucositis, and possibly GVHD), thereby improving disease-free survival rates. Similarly, the potential benefits of alemtuzumab in the proposed conditioning regimen are increased rates of hematopoietic engraftment with less toxicity than that observed with cyclophosphamide, ultimately resulting in improved immune function and enhanced quality of life (12,13). A fludarabine/alemtuzumab-based, less intensive conditioning regimen with adequate immunosuppressive activity could conceivably allow more successful engraftment of stem cells from related donors in patients with genetic lymphohematological diseases, as well as lower rates of transplant-related mortality.

Regimen-related toxicity is also believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD (14). Therefore, conditioning regimens that cause less tissue injury may also lead to reduced GVHD. In the present study, the use of alemtuzumab in the conditioning regimen may be an added benefit, as this antibody causes T-cell depletion, thus, the risk of GVHD may also be reduced (15). The overall goal of the study is to improve the therapeutic index of HSCT by decreasing and, if possible, eliminating cyclophosphamide as a component of the pre-transplant conditioning for patients with genetic diseases of lymphohematopoiesis. The investigation will explore the risks and benefits of the proposed novel-conditioning regimen using a decreased dose of cyclophosphamide and additional immunosuppression with fludarabine and alemtuzumab to prevent graft rejection and recurrence of disease. The investigators will evaluate this regimen's impact on conditioning-related morbidity and mortality, and measure the success of the transplant procedure by engraftment and disease-free survival. If this regimen is able to successfully permit engraftment and reduce regimen-related toxicity, the next phase of treatment will test a further dose de-escalation for cyclophosphamide. It is anticipated that there will be four dose levels of cyclophosphamide in the overall study: 1) 105 mg/kg; 2) 70 mg/kg; 3) 35 mg/kg; and then finally, 4) 0 mg/kg. This study design was chosen to minimize study risks possibly associated with substitution of fludarabine and alemtuzumab for CY as immunoablation. The present protocol represents Level 1 in the study design; an amended protocol will be prepared prior to further de-escalation of the cyclophosphamide dose.","Many genetic diseases of lymphohematopoietic cells (such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Combined Immune Deficiency (CID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, and metabolic diseases affecting hematopoiesis) are sublethal diseases caused by mutations that adversely affect the development or function of different types of blood cells. Although pathophysiologically diverse, these genetic diseases share a similar clinical course of significant progressive morbidity, overall poor quality of life, and ultimate death from complications of the disease or its palliative treatment. Supportive care for these diseases includes chronic transfusion, iron chelation, and surgery (splenectomy or cholecystectomy) for the hemoglobinopathies; prophylactic antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and immunomodulator therapies for the immune deficiencies; and enzyme replacement injections and dietary restriction for some of the metabolic diseases. The suboptimal results of such supportive care measures have led to efforts to implement more aggressive therapeutic interventions to cure these lymphohematopoietic diseases. The most logical strategies for cure of these diseases have been either replacement of the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with those derived from a normal donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or to genetically modify the patient's own stem cells to replace the defective gene (gene therapy)."

Not yet recruiting,September 2019,,18 Years,Anticipated,600,"Participant Enrollment (pre-test):

This system component enables the participant to start the process prior to the visit by enabling the participant to enter his/her personal information into the DGA system. This step is estimated to takes approximately ten minutes and is expected to save valuable time should they need to come for a genetic counseling session. Using this component, the medical questionnaire will self-adjust to address the clinical scenario related to each participant. This component will allow the attending physician to receive virtually all required information about the participant prior to their meeting, thereby improving communication with the participants, and potentially referring them to relevant tests even prior to their meeting. In the face-to-face meeting between the participants and the medical professional, most of the report summarizing treatment and family history, which the medical professional would have usually spent precious time filling, will be automatically ready, allowing for easy editing and finalization.

Next, the participant is guided through an on-line introductory personalized video explaining the genetic test and its implications tailored to the medical information that the participant entered in the questionnaire. The participant's understanding of the information presented in the personalized introductory video is tested by three questions. The participant must accurately answer the three questions. If the participant makes two mistakes the application opens the video in the relevant section and then asks the participant again. Following a successful completion of this step the participant is invited to sign an electronic Informed Consent to carry out the routine CarrierScan screening test (which is not a part of this study). The participants will re-sign a hard copy Informed Consent upon arrival to the Sheba Genetic Institute. A dedicated dashboard enables medical staff to monitor the progression of a participant along the process.

Step 1. Registration: During the initial phone call with potential participants, qualified staff that are part of the study will explain the process and extend an invitation to participated in the study. The DGA process will begin when the Sheba Medical Center (MC) Genetics Institute will send potential participants a link following the initial phone call between them. This link will enable the participant a secure connection to the DGA system. During the initial registration to the system the participant will undergo authentication using the standard two-factor authentication method based on phone number and the last four digits of the ID number of the participant. At the end of this process a new user will be created in the system.

Step 2. Interactive medical questionnaire: The interactive medical questionnaire is defined as the process of gathering personal information relevant to the specific clinical genetic scenario (e.g. personal information, personal and family medical information). The interactive medical questionnaire incorporated in the Enrollment app is based on Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for carrier screening. The questionnaire is dynamic and is interactively adapted based on live information supplied by the participant. In addition, the questionnaire is taking advantage of ""natural language form"", a user experience technique for drafting the questions, for a higher compliance rate. The questionnaire was approved by the Sheba MC PI.

Please note that the essence of the DGA system is to enable to conduct genetically relevant medical informatics processes in the context of digital sessions with secured and adaptive systems. Such data collection, pedigree drawing, and risk calculation takes place during face-to-face or over the phone meetings with medical staff using the currently practiced genetics counseling paradigm.

Step 4. Sample submission and signing a hard copy Informed Consent for the CarrierScan test: At the Sheba MC Genetic Institute, before the submission of buccal/saliva/blood samples to the test, participants will be asked to sign a hard copy Informed Consent.

Note: The CarrierScan screening test in not part of this study. Step 5. Introductory personalized animated video: A personalized and dynamic animated video is machine-generated following a well-characterized medically supervised algorithm to tailor the video to each participant. The algorithm that generates the personalized introductory video is approved by the Sheba medical staff. Participants will receive a short-animated video summarizing the medical process they are going through. The content of these videos is dynamic and in full alignment with the Sheba MC requirements.

Following the dynamic video, the system will examine participants' understanding by a short interactive quiz that summarizes the relevant topics presented in the video. If the user answers wrong twice, he or she will be directed to the section in the video that provides the information to answer correctly. It is important for the usability study to test the responsiveness of the participant to sign the electronic Informed Consent following the personalized introductory video. The investigators believe that this video will provide a clear and, in most cases, more thorough explanation than the common face-to-face explanation.

e-Learning (general information on genetics and preconception): Provides education to the participant on basic genetic principles and concepts by a series of short dynamic videos making up an e-learning center.

On Board Dashboard for the Medical Staff:

A user-friendly dashboard will be accessible to relevant approved medical staff. It will include all the information gathered from the participant during the completion of the on-line registration and questionnaire process. Once the participant concludes the session of Participant Enrollment (Pre-Test), all his/her data are presented on the medical staff dashboard. A genetic counselor will be able to accept, reject, and/or revise the data. Next, the genetic counselor will send the participant a signed summary letter (PDF) via the DGA system, in a secured protocol (just as in the initial connection of the participant to the Sheba MC application). This letter will present the information entered into the system by the participant and invite him/her to perform the genetic test. Using the standard two-factor authentication method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID number, the participants will be able to view the report.

Counseling rationale - the logics of the DGA system (the ""brain""):

This module processes participant information gathered during the participant enrollment process in combination with the results of the CarrierScan screening test. Residual risk is calculated automatically, and the system is ready to preset the medical staff with its suggestion on how to proceed. The Genetic Counseling Dashboard presents the supervising clinician with all relevant information for their approval or for further comments and edits. The results of the genetic tests are uploaded to the Sheba MC secured cloud. All processes described in this section also take place in the secure Sheba MC cloud.

Note: Only anonymization information of participants will be transferred to Igentify for analysis, assessment and improvement of the system.

DGA Algorithm: Next, the system utilizes its medically supervised genetic algorithm to decide on the outcome of the genetic counseling (high or low risk). The algorithm takes advantage of all relevant information in the system including the predictions of the residual risk. The outcomes of the system are either a digital report generator (see next section) or in the cases of couples that have been found to be at high risk, an invitation to a face-to-face genetic counseling session.
Genetic Counseling Dashboard (to medical staff in Sheba MC): Presents all the information gathered from the participant to the relevant medical staff, enabling decision-making regarding participant outcomes. The dashboard will enable the medical staff to approve or reject the suggestion of the DGA algorithm with regards to the participant's risk and the subsequent process. The system will raise flags in cases that action is needed and will support the subsequent face-to-face/telephone genetic counseling with reporting tools.
Interface for genetic results: Enables the DGA to incorporate genetic results from various genetic tests. In the current study, the DGA will work only with results of tests done at the Sheba MC genetic lab for the expanded carrier screening (CarrierScan and Fragile-X tests).

Counseling Summary Session:

Once the clinician approves the suggested decision of the DGA algorithm, this module is responsible to generate two types of outputs. Low risk participants (namely couples that were not found to be carriers of mutations in the same genes) are approved to receive an automated digital report (personalized video), while high risk participants are urged to schedule a face-to-face genetic counseling session. In high risk cases, the genetic counselor will have the digital information provided by the participants and the genetic test results, to make the counseling process more effective. The threshold of high/low risk assignment is determined by the head of the Sheba Genetic Institute.

Digital Genetic Counseling Report Generator: This component generates an animated, personalized dynamic video and a hard copy report (in PDF format) summarizing the genetic counseling provided to the participant online. Using the standard two-factor authentication method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID number, the participants will be able to view the personalized video and download the reports.
This module is responsible to coherently convey all personal and mandatory messages compatible with the guidelines of the Sheba Genetic Institute. The report is machine-generated and approved by medical personnel before its disclosure to the participant.

Having the DGA video available to the participants will allow them to review it repeatedly, until full understanding of the topic is achieved, as self-assessed by the participant. Each review will be recorded for medico-legal purposes.

• Support for In-Person Genetic Counseling: Face-to-face genetic counseling for high-risk participants will be aided by the system. The system dashboards will present the genetic counselor with a full report containing all gathered information to-date, which will be augmented with digital tools, such as pedigree editor and short self-explanatory animated videos aimed to facilitate an effective session.",The DGA provides an end-to-end digital solution to the preconception carrier screening process from participant registration to receipt of the test results and their interpretations. These steps are provided using personalized animated videos.
Recruiting,"January 15, 2019",55 Years,18 Years,Anticipated,55,"This is a prospective cohort study design for fetuses or neonates affected with NIHF. Mother-father-fetus trios of pregnancies complicated by idiopathic non-immune fetal hydrops will be identified. These patients will be counseled by a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist as would be the routine. As part of the routine work-up, amniocentesis will be recommended for karyotype, CMA and an infectious work-up. Amniocentesis will be performed by the Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist of the referring institution. The patient will also be offered genetic counseling (routine). Subjects will be offered enrollment when inclusion criteria are met. After enrollment, the following samples will be collected: (1) maternal blood (2) paternal blood, (3) fetal DNA isolated from amniocytes (4) neonatal blood when referral is done postnatally. The WES results will be reported to the genetic counselor dedicated to the study. The parents will be contacted by the genetic counselor and counseled on the findings whether they were positive or negative. The result will also be communicated to the patient's primary MFM provider or pediatrician and appropriate referrals to pediatric genetics specialists will be made by the primary provider. In cases where no genetic disorder is identified, the sample will be stored and then subsequently whole genome sequencing will be performed.","Brief Summary: Non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by abnormal fluid accumulation in two or more fetal compartments. Numerous etiologies may lead to NIHF, and the underlying cause often remains unclear (1). The current standard of genetic diagnostic testing includes a fetal karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA), with an option to pursue single gene testing on amniocytes collected by amniocentesis (2). A large subgroup of the NIHF causes includes single gene disorders that are not diagnosed with the standard genetic workup for hydrops. Currently, nearly 1 in 5 cases of NIHF is defined as idiopathic, meaning there is no identified etiology (2). The investigators believe this is because the causes of NIHF are not completely investigated, specifically single gene disorders. Our research study aims to increase the diagnostic yield by performing whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on prenatal and neonatal NIHF cases when standard genetic testing is negative, identifying known and new genes, thus providing vital information to families regarding the specific diagnosis and risk to future pregnancies. The investigators plan to perform WES as the initial diagnostic test. If WES is negative, then the investigators will proceed to perform WGS."
Enrolling by invitation,"February 20, 2018",21 Years,,Anticipated,1000,"The goal of this collaborative research is to study human genomes in children with suspected congenital disease, multiple-congenital anomalies and/or multi-organ disease of unknown etiology, in order to understand the potential value of WGS in establishing a genetic diagnosis. The study will examine diagnosis rates, changes in clinical care as a result of a genetic diagnosis, health economics including potential cost-effectiveness of WGS, and patient and provider experience with genomic medicine. Other clinical information of the type collected by treating physicians and stored in electronic medical records will also be collected to aid in the interpretation of laboratory data. Participants will also be asked to consent for future access of the medical record, future research on biospecimens and data generated from genomic sequencing, and for the ability to re-contact.

As part of this effort, Nicklaus Children's Hospital plans to create a large integrated database that contains the DNA sequences of the participants' whole human genomes and additional health information regarding characteristics and health of the persons whose samples have been sequenced. Scientists can then use the database to try to link those traits, diseases, and other conditions to changes in the sequence of the genome. Nicklaus Children's Hospital plans to make the database available to its collaborators, such as RCIGM, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and other academic institutions which will use the database to find better, innovative ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer and other diseases. De-identified data from this study will be shared with the community at-large, including publications and public databases. In addition, participants will be given the option to allow biospecimens (i.e., residual blood, saliva, CSF, etc.) to be included in biorepositories at Nicklaus Children's Hospital and Rady Pediatric Genomics & Systems Medicine Institute (RCIGM).

The study will provide clinical laboratory-confirmed results related to the affected patient's phenotype, including optional incidental findings unless subjects opt-out for these additional results, to allow for these research findings to be used in clinical care. Furthermore, this study will aggregate data regarding standard clinical genetic testing as well as cost measures to not only identify differences in diagnostic rates, diagnostic accuracy, and times to diagnoses, but to determine the cost-effectiveness of this testing and subsequent changes in care management. Clinical utility will be defined as changes in care that follow directly from results of genetic testing (both positive and negative), including standard clinical tests and WGS. This data will be used to further examine the analytic, diagnostic, and clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this testing.

WGS methods continue to improve and pediatric genomic medicine is a very new field of medical practice. This study will also inform investigators regarding best practices, both in terms of traditional medical outcomes and patient-centered outcomes. Consequently, this study will also act as a biorepository for samples and data as the ability to share genomic and phenotypic data amongst researchers is critical to progressing our understanding of the nascent field of pediatric genomic medicine.

Specific Aims:

Use WGS to identify new genetic diagnoses in children with multiple congenital anomalies, developmental delay, autism, seizures, intellectual disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic illness.
Evaluate the diagnosis rate of genetic diseases by WGS in previously undiagnosed patients.
Assess the clinical utility of WGS in the care and management of patients.

Completed,"February 19, 2007",,18 Years,,550,"How to effectively educate the public about inherited risk is an important communication issue now and will likely become even more important over the next decade. Little research has been conducted, however, to examine how to communicate about this topic with individuals from underserved populations. The planned study provides a unique and innovative opportunity to examine how to reach an underserved community and present information about inherited risk in an understandable and usable form by building upon an existing relationship between NHGRI and the National Council of La Raza (NCLR). NCLR has previously designed a culturally tailored lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to increase knowledge and awareness about inherited risk among Latinos and to motivate them to seek information about their family history. The primary objective of this study will be to examine the pathways by which the LHA communication intervention impacts information seeking outcome variables. We will examine the roles of possible mediating variables (i.e., perceived information need, conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy) and assess the effects of contextual variables (i.e., family and personal history of disease, genetic beliefs, acculturation, health care access, sociodemographic variables) on the outcomes. The second objective is to provide quantitative data on the effects of the intervention on information seeking outcome measures (i.e., discussing family history with family members and health care providers) by comparing the intervention to a brochure-only condition; these data can inform the planning of a large-scale randomized controlled intervention trial. A third objective is to examine predictors of intention to seek information about family history at baseline. A quasi-experimental design will be used; we will recruit 350 individuals to participate in the LHA intervention and 200 to a brochure-only comparison group. All participants will be Spanish-speaking healthy volunteers who are at least 18 years of age and have basic Spanish reading and writing skills. Participants will be recruited through community-based clinics in Oakland, CA and Washington, DC and will either participate in a LHA or be asked to read information about family history. They will complete brief, self-administered questionnaires in Spanish before and after participating in the intervention or reading the brochure. Because of the quasi-experimental design, multiple logistic regression models will be used in the analysis in order to control for covariates. Understanding how to effectively inform underserved communities about inherited risk is a research area of critical importance if genomics is to be used to benefit the public health.","This study will examine how to communicate with an underserved population about inherited disease risks. It will present information about inherited risk to a Latino population through either a lay health advisor (LHA) or through printed information. The LHA is a member of the Latino community who has received training in public speaking, group facilitation, and managing group dynamics and in family health history and genetics. Previous studies have shown that an LHA can effectively communicate health information to diverse audiences, but such interventions have not been studied in the context of inherited risk.

Spanish-speaking Latino men and women over the age of 18 in the Oakland, CA, and Washington, DC, areas who have basic Spanish reading and writing skills may be eligible for this study.

Completed,"December 1, 2014",50 Years,20 Years,Actual,500,"Research background Preimplantational genetic screen (PGS) is tool for diagnosis of embryo chromosome abnormality before transfer. Under this tool, patients with a family history of genetic disease or special genetic disease could avoid to produce chromosomal abnormalities of the next pregnant. For the preemergence of embryos before the genetic diagnosis must be carried out artificial reproductive treatment, the process includes induction of ovulation, ovulation, in vitro fertilization and embryo culture, to embryos grow to six to eight cells or cultured into the stage of blastocyst stage, Under the embryonic section, take one or several cells, the slices of cells for genetic diagnosis, select the embryo without genetic disease implanted in the uterine cavity, in order to avoid the birth of genetic disease offspring.

Recruiting,"July 17, 2015",100 Years,1 Year,Anticipated,16000,"Without an explanation for severe and sometimes life-threatening symptoms, patients and their families are left in a state of unknown. Many individuals find themselves being passed from physician to physician, undergoing countless and often repetitive tests in the hopes of finding answers and insight about what the future may hold. This long and arduous journey to find a diagnosis does not end for many patients- the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) notes that 6% of individuals seeking their assistance have an undiagnosed disorder. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) was established with the goal of providing care and answers for these individuals with mysterious conditions who have long eluded diagnosis. The NIH UDP is a joint venture of the NIH ORDR, the National Human Genome Research Institute Intramural Research Program (NHGRI-IRP), and the NIH Clinical Research Center (CRC). The goals of the NIH UDP are to: (1) provide answers for patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) generate new knowledge about disease mechanisms; (3) assess the application of new approaches to phenotyping and the use of genomic technologies; and (4) identify potential therapeutic targets, if possible. To date, the UDP has evaluated 3300 medical records and admitted 750 individuals with rare and undiagnosed conditions to the NIH Clinical Center. The NIH UDP has identified more than

70 rare disease diagnoses and several new conditions. The success of the NIH UDP prompted the NIH Common Fund to support the establishment of a network of medical research centers, the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), for fiscal years 2013-2022. The clinical sites will perform extensive phenotyping, genetic analyses, and functional studies of potential disease-causing variants. The testing performed on patients involves medically indicated studies intended to help reach a diagnosis, as well as research investigations that include a skin biopsy, blood draws, and DNA analysis. In addition, the UDN will further the goals of the UDP by permitting the sharing of personally identifiable phenotypic and genotypic information within the network. By sharing participant information and encouraging collaboration, the UDN hopes to improve the understanding of rare conditions and advance the diagnostic process and care for individuals with undiagnosed diseases.","Background:

This proposal includes a number of collaborators who have had extremely close, extensive interaction with the Lancaster County Amish over the past decade; their relationships with the community are invaluable to the success of this project. We have had substantial success with this research over the past seven years, leading to the discovery of the molecular etiology of four human diseases and the establishment of a useful database and tools for genealogical analysis.

Recruiting,January 2004,,,Anticipated,1800,"A key component of lung defense is the efficiency of mucociliary clearance (MCC).

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a human genetic disorder with defective MCC. This ongoing project is designed to identify additional disease-causing mutations in PCD, and correlate the molecular etiologies with the ciliary phenotype (ultrastructure, wave form and beat frequency). We have recently shown that the normal human cilium has a distinctive waveform, i.e. beats in-plane with defined curvatures and amplitudes for the effective (forward) and recovery stroke. We hypothesize that discrete sets of genes contribute to the structure and function of the ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA), inner dynein arm (IDA), and central pair (CP) and radial spoke (RS) complex (CP/RS), and that we can identify novel genetic mutations in different structural components of the cilium that will have different effects on ciliary ultrastructure, wave form, and beat frequency. Importantly, we are now able to identify patients with PCD who do not have hallmark diagnostic ultrastructural defects, based on distinctive clinical phenotypes (including situs inversus), low or borderline nasal NO production, and abnormal ciliary motility. Identification of PCD patients with normal ciliary ultrastructure (~16% of PCD patients at UNC) offers the opportunity to discover mutations in genes that cause functional, but not ultrastructural, defects (such as DNAH11), and to correlate those mutations with ciliary waveform abnormalities. Over the past 4 years, we have made great progress in identifying mutations in 2 genes (DNAI1 and DNAH5) that cause ~60% of ODA defects in PCD, and ~35% of PCD overall. We will extend our search for disease causing mutations in PCD, using several different approaches, including studies of additional candidate genes, (guided by ultrastructure), plus insights from ciliary proteomics, and family-based studies. Taken together, these studies will provide new insights regarding the relationship of mutations in specific genes to ciliary ultrastructural and functional defects. These studies will not only greatly enhance our ability to diagnose PCD, but will also lead to discovery of ""milder"" genetic mutations associated with normal ciliary ultrastructure, and likely some residual ciliary function. Ultimately, this will allow future studies of the role of partial loss of ciliary function in the predisposition to more common airways diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","The overall short-term goals of this project include the following: 1) identify the genes that are key to the function of respiratory cilia to protect the normal lung; and 2) the effects of genetic mutations that adversely affect ciliary function and cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which results in life-shortening lung disease. The long-term goal of this project is to develop better understanding of the underlying genetic variability that adversely modifies ciliary function, and predisposes to common airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Recruiting,December 2019,,,Anticipated,1,"1. INTRODUCTION

For some neurological and neurodegenerative diseases genetic inheritance is well documented, and guidelins have been improved to ensure a quality diagnostic approach. Unfortunately, this scenario is not reproducible for most of the neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, also when a strong genetic component is documented. This is due to:

Polygenicity, where different genes can contribute to the same phenotype (eg Spastic Paraplegia, associated with over 50 genes)
Multifactorial diseases, genetic can explains only a part of the etiology of the disease (such as Parkinson's disease in which the identified genes are responsible for only 15% of patients with a clinical diagnosis)
Disorders with well established genetic component, but the responsible genes has not been identified.

Therefore, sometimes it impossible or unlikely to complete a molecular diagnosis for patients with a classical or complex phenotypes New technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), allow the analysis of hundreds of genes in a single experiment. The implementation of these technologies will help to identify new genes and new variants associate

2. DESIGN STUDY

The goal of this study is to improve the diagnostic approach in molecular genetics through NGS. This will allow to characterize genomic variations and new genes responsible for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, NGS will identify:

1. New genes associated with diseases characterized by genetic heterogeneity, Mendelian and polygenic heredity.

2. New variations responsible for disease or that can increase genetic susceptibility.

3. EXPERIMENTAL PHASE (Attachment 1)

Neurology and, if required, Genetic Counseling.
Genetic Counseling identifies the molecular analysis for a specific patient. A blood sample of 6 milliliters will be collected after informed consent (informed consent Neuromed version 2.12.2015).
Specific guidelines for each test will be followed for the first diagnostic approach. Molecular analyses are carried out at the Institute of Molecular Genetics Center IRCCS INM Neuromed using Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and microsatellites.
If the specific analysis will not detect the mutations, NGS panel consisting in 4,813 genes associated with known clinical phenotypes (clinical exome, or Mendeliome) will be applied.

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS

DNA/RNA EXTRACTION Genomic DNA will be isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes according to standard procedures. Total RNA will be isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of DNA/RNA samples will be determinate using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Life Technologies).
MLPA (Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) is a multiplex PCR method detecting abnormal copy numbers of up to 50 different genomic DNA or RNA sequences, which is able to distinguish sequences differing in only one nucleotide.

Typical for MLPA is that it is not target sequences that are amplified, but MLPA probes that hybridise to the target sequence. In contrast to a standard multiplex PCR, a single pair PCR primers is used for MLPA amplification. The resulting amplification products of a SALSA MLPA kits range between 130 and 480 nt in length and can be analysed by capillary electrophoresis. Comparing the peak pattern obtained to that of reference samples indicates which sequences show aberrant copy numbers.

The MLPA reaction can be divided in five major steps: 1) DNA denaturation and hybridisation of MLPA probes; 2) ligation reaction; 3) PCR reaction; 4) separation of amplification products by electrophoresis; and 5) data analysis

• SEQUENCING

The DNA sample to be sequenced is combined in a tube with primer, DNA polymerase, and DNA nucleotides (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP). The four dye-labeled, chain-terminating dideoxy nucleotides are added as well, but in much smaller amounts than the ordinary nucleotides.

The mixture is first heated to denature the template DNA (separate the strands), then cooled so that the primer can bind to the single-stranded template. Once the primer has bound, the temperature is raised again, allowing DNA polymerase to synthesize new DNA starting from the primer. DNA polymerase will continue adding nucleotides to the chain until it happens to add a dideoxy nucleotide instead of a normal one. At that point, no further nucleotides can be added, so the strand will end with the dideoxy nucleotide.

This process is repeated in a number of cycles. By the time the cycling is complete, it's virtually guaranteed that a dideoxy nucleotide will have been incorporated at every single position of the target DNA in at least one reaction. That is, the tube will contain fragments of different lengths, ending at each of the nucleotide positions in the original DNA (see figure below). The ends of the fragments will be labeled with dyes that indicate their final nucleotide. After the reaction is done, the fragments are run through a long, thin tube containing a gel matrix in a process called capillary gel electrophoresis. Short fragments move quickly through the pores of the gel, while long fragments move more slowly. As each fragment crosses the ""finish line"" at the end of the tube, it's illuminated by a laser, allowing the attached dye to be detected.

The smallest fragment (ending just one nucleotide after the primer) crosses the finish line first, followed by the next-smallest fragment (ending two nucleotides after the primer), and so forth. Thus, from the colors of dyes registered one after another on the detector, the sequence of the original piece of DNA can be built up one nucleotide at a time. The data recorded by the detector consist of a series of peaks in fluorescence intensity, as shown in the chromatogram above. The DNA sequence is read from the peaks in the chromatogram.

• MICROSATELLITE Microsatellite analysis includes PCR amplification of the microsatellite loci using fluorescently labeled primers (6-FAM, TET, HEX, NED); labeled PCR products are then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (ABI PRISM 310 and 3130 XL Applied Biosystem) (CE) or electrophoresis to separate the alleles by size.

The results were processed using the GENESCAN and GENOTYPER5 programs. Once established the values of individual alleles, they were assigned to each individual.

• NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (NGS)

In principle, the concept behind NGS technology is similar to CE sequencing—DNA polymerase catalyzes the incorporation of fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) into a DNA template strand during sequential cycles of DNA synthesis. During each cycle, at the point of incorporation, the nucleotides are identified by fluorophore excitation. The critical difference is that, instead of sequencing a single DNA fragment, NGS extends this process across millions of fragments in a massively parallel fashion. Illumina sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry is the most widely adopted chemistry in the industry and delivers the highest accuracy, the highest yield of error-free reads, and the highest percentage of base calls above Q30.6-8 The Illumina NGS workflows include 4 basic steps (Figure 3):

o Library Preparation—The sequencing library is prepared by random fragmentation of the DNA or cDNA sample, followed by 5' and 3' adapter ligation. Alternatively, ""tagmentation"" combines the fragmentation and ligation reactions into a single step that greatly increases the efficiency of the library preparation process.9 Adapter-ligated fragments are then PCR amplified and gel purified.

o Cluster Generation—For cluster generation, the library is loaded into a flow cell where fragments are captured on a lawn of surface-bound oligos complementary to the library adapters. Each fragment is then amplified into distinct, clonal clusters through bridge amplification. When cluster generation is complete, the templates are ready for sequencing.

o Sequencing—Illumina technology utilizes a proprietary reversible terminator-based method that detects single bases as they are incorporated into DNA template strands. As all 4 reversible terminator-bound dNTPs are present during each sequencing cycle, natural competition minimizes incorporation bias and greatly reduces raw error rates compared to other technologies.6, 7 The result is highly accurate base-by-base sequencing that virtually eliminates sequence-context-specific errors, even within repetitive sequence regions and homopolymers.

o Data Analysis—During data analysis and alignment, the newly identified sequence reads are then aligned to a reference genome. Following alignment, many variations of analysis are possible such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or insertion-deletion (indel) identification, read counting for RNA methods, phylogenetic or metagenomic analysis, and more.

6. ETHICAL ASPECTS This study follow the ethical standards of Helsinki Declaration and its revisions. The study will be conducted taking into account the regulatory requirements and compliance with the law. The informed consent already approved previously by the ethics committee.","For some neurological and neurodegenerative diseases genetic inheritance is well documented (described as Mendelian or multifactorial), but sometimes specific mutations or family segregation evidences have not been identified. Considering this scenario, most of the times it is impossible or unlikely to identify the responsible gene, or the private mutation, of a patient affected by a neurodegenerative disease.

New technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), allow the analysis of hundreds of genes in a single experiment. The implementation of these technologies will help to identify new genes and new variants associated with neurological diseases. Using this approach, several molecular genetic diagnosis will definitely find the needle in a haystack, and will be able to be used in the clinical practice."

Unknown status,June 2014,50 Years,18 Years,Anticipated,160,"Rationale: Conventional prenatal diagnosis (PND) for single-gene disorders requires invasive procedures, either chorionic villus sampling between 11 and 14 weeks gestation or amniocentesis after 15 weeks. Although these approaches to obtain foetal DNA currently provide the golden standard for PND, the invasive procedures carry a risk of miscarriage of 0.5-1%. A reliable non-invasive alternative has long been sought. Circulating cell-free foetal (cff) nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which are present in maternal blood during pregnancy, can be used for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). NIPT for some chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, 13, 18) is now validated. NIPT for other chromosomal anomalies is still under development. NIPT of single-gene disorders is technically very challenging, due to the predominance of maternal DNA sequences, Some small studies have shown that a very limited number of monogenic genetic disorders can currently be diagnosed in maternal blood. In general de novo mutations in the foetus and paternally transmitted disorders are less difficult to diagnose than maternally transmitted disorders.

In this study, the investigators aim to develop non-invasive targeted molecular analysis using cell free fetal (cff) DNA and cff RNA for single-gene disorders, in pregnant women referred to the departments of Clinical Genetics of Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) and Radboud University Medical Centre (RUMC) for conventional PND. The investigators will contribute to literature by confirming earlier published results, and by adding other single-gene disorders or mutations to the list of disorders for which the possibility of the use of cff DNA will be examined.

Objective: Developing targeted non-invasive prenatal analysis for single-gene disorders using cff DNA and RNA in maternal plasma.

Study design: This study is a proof of concept study in which we aim to demonstrate that molecular analysis can indicate the presence or absence of (a) mutant allele(s) in maternal plasma.

Study population: Pregnant women (≥18y) referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics of MUMC+ or RadboudUMC for conventional PND, for one of the following reasons:

The fetus is at high risk of having inherited a dominant or recessive disorder of his/her affected parent(s).
The fetus at risk of having a de novo disorder on the basis of ultrasonography findings.

Main study endpoints: Does targeted molecular analysis of cff DNA and RNA indicate

the presence or absence of (a) mutant allele(s) in maternal plasma
the presence of a sufficient concentration of foetal nucleic acids in the maternal plasma to reliably diagnose the monogenic disorder Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation and benefit: minimal burden: one moment of blood sampling for the pregnant woman and her partner. In most cases the blood sampling will be combined with regular blood sampling. Benefit: no benefit for this pregnancy as in the study phase the result of the invasive prenatal test is leading.","Developing a new non-invasive prenatal test for single gene disorders from cell free fetal DNA, retrieved from the mothers blood."
"Active, not recruiting","August 25, 2017",,,Anticipated,300,"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disease that affects collagen synthesis and structure resulting in multisystem connective tissue involvement with twelve different subtypes. The clinical manifestations of EDS include skin hyperextensibility, skin fragility, joint hypermobility, muscle hypotonia, easy bruising, and mast cell hypersensitivity. We recently reported a cases series of EDS patients with different signs and symptoms. Most were evaluated along with their parents for evidence of acquired or inherited bone diseases. What is remarkable is that 93% of our cases at least one parent had clinically documented evidence for EDS a genetic disorder that compromises the structural integrity of the collagen/elastin matrix. Most of the parents were unaware they had this genetic disorder and the diagnosis was made for the first time in our clinic. Our previous study for reviewing patient's medical records was approved by the Boston University Medical Center's IRB. We have access to EDS patients from referrals and from Dr Holick's clinic. We plan to collect the blood and saliva samples from EDS patients and their relatives for this genetic study.

Genetic evaluation in limited number of our patients showed some causative variations. For example, one of our cases the patient was evaluated at an outside hospital for a causative variant in the COL5A1, COL5A2, FKBP14, and TNXB genes, which were negative, but she was found later to have a causative variant in serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade F, member 1 (SERPINF1) gene. A causative variation in SERPINF1 gene has been associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) /EDS overlap syndrome and the mutation in this gene causes type VI OI.

The highly variable clinical presentation of patients with the hypermobility and clinical signs for EDS prompted an effort to classify patients with EDS into more homogeneous groups that can aid in diagnosis and management. This resulted in the establishment of 14 types (include 6 major types and 8 minor types). This classification acknowledges the presence of ""others"" including ""unspecified"" forms making it clear that the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of EDS could not be fully captured by that classification. Indeed, there have been numerous reports of patients with hereditary disorders of connective tissue, which have overlapping clinical manifestations of EDS, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria.

For decades, the genetic basis of heritable disorders of connective tissue had remained largely unknown. The rise of molecular genetics and its advances in next-generation sequencing has unlocked doors that continues to lead to major advances in understanding the causative genes for many genetic disorders.

Evaluation of subjects with these conditions often includes molecular testing which has important counseling, therapeutic and sometimes legal implications. An accurate molecular diagnosis can provide the basis for counseling regarding prognosis and reproductive options. Accurate genetic diagnosis has been shown to provide psychological benefits to patients and their families. In order to facilitate sequencing of multiple genes causing some of the common forms of these heritable conditions, we have designed this genetic study to obtain data for the genetic variations of EDS by next generation sequencing. The next generation sequencing panel may be of value in guiding future clinical pathways for genetic diagnosis in EDS. We plan to recruit EDS patients and their relatives for genetic testing. We also plan to submit a NIH grant for this purpose and provide required preliminary data through this pilot grant about genetic variation of EDS.

The primary objective is to compare genetic variations in EDS patients with their relatives. We expect to find some genetic variations that may explain clinical signs and symptoms in EDS patients.

Secondary objective is to provide a novel testing panel on a single diagnostic platform for EDS. After performing next generation sequencing, we plan to design a genetic panel for EDS.

A third objective will be to determine if saliva can be as good and reliable source of DNA for genetic testing as DNA obtained from blood.","We are planning to collected blood and saliva for DNA extraction to use for genetic testing of children and adults with EDS and their relatives. Medical records from other institutions and clinical notes for visits in Dr. Holick's clinic will be reviewed to obtain the following information: previous diagnosis at other institutions, age, clinical signs and symptoms of EDS, Joints Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS), , and other metabolic or genetic disorders and laboratory results, radiology reports and images, and genetic testing that supports these diagnoses. Subjects' peripheral vein blood and saliva will be taken. No clinical intervention/randomizations will be performed. No patients' identifiers will be reported.

In this pilot study genomic DNA will be extracted and will be used for genotyping as sequencing in 30 EDS patients and their 30 relatives with or without EDS to compare genetic variations between them. After validation by Sanger sequencing for these variations, we plan to prepare a genetic panel for EDS. After all validation testing, we plan to evaluate the saliva DNA in a similar manner and compare the results with those obtained from the DNA from the blood sample. The purpose is that if they are comparable, we will be able to use saliva in place of blood as it easier method for accessing a person's DNA. This will be especially helpful for evaluating infants or those patients who prefer not to have a blood sample drawn. NOTE: Results of this study will not be disclosed to subjects."

Recruiting,"October 1, 2015",28 Days,,Anticipated,2000,"Neonatal congenital malformation is one of the most frequent cause of infant death in the western world and major cities of China. There are many different types of congenital malformations, and some of these can be caused by changes in gene mutation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput parallel sequencing that can provide genetic information with high accuracy. It is a faster and cost-effective method to detect gene mutations compared to Sanger sequencing. We hope to couple genomic techniques with more traditional methods involved in genetic discovery in order to investigate a broad range of conditions for which there is strong evidence that genetic factors are involved. So In this study, we evaluated the clinical role of NGS testing for neonatal genetic disease in newborns compared to Sanger sequencing to observe whether this new technology can significantly shorten the time of examination, improve the diagnosis rate, guide the intervention treatments and promote prognosis.

These neonates who have an undiagnosed illness, and partial families, will be eligible to participate in the study. The study population will be recruited from Children's Hospital of Fudan University inpatient population, primarily the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with a subpopulation presenting to other hospitals in China. All affected study participants will receive a genetic screening according to their clinical symptom. All subjects will have blood drawn for DNA isolation and genomic sequencing at the time of enrollment in the study. All blood sample volumes will adhere to the Fudan procedure on maximum blood in pediatric patients. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid and tissue samples may be collected and stored in the bank of biosamples. DNA will be isolated and prepared for NGS or Sanger with Fudan protocols at the Translational Medicine Center of Children's Hospital of Fudan University. Partial familial samples will also be obtained, and nucleic acids will also be sequenced, as indicated, to assist in diagnosis of the genetic disease in the newborn. All sequencing data will be stored in the Genome Center Biorepository. In the case of positive study findings that may be diagnostic, our investigator will perform confirmatory clinical diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, a standard clinical diagnostic report will be placed in the patient's medical record. Follow up with the patient's family will be guided by the clinical care team. Both molecular diagnoses results and duration to diagnosis will be recorded as primary outcomes.

In addition, this information will help alleviate anxiety on the part of the family, and also provides a mechanism for patient crossover into the rapid NGS arm if the patient is clinically deteriorating, and at the clinical care team's request. Each time a study participant is enrolled, the clinician and parents will be asked to fill out a survey prior to NGS testing and after return of results. We will also review the patient's medical record and collect clinical variables including laboratory testing, radiology results, medications and other treatments received to further analyze the effect NGS has on clinical care.

Completed,"May 22, 1996",,,Actual,12,"Males with the X-linked ymphoproliferative disease (XLPD) have a marked susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease. These boys develop very severe disease associated with infectious mononucleosis; others develop hypogammaglobulinemia or B cell lymphomas. Recent studies have linked the disease to a region of the X-chromosome. The purpose of this study is to determine the function of the gene responsible for XLPD. Blood samples or discarded tissues (e.g. previous biopsy or autopsy material) from patients with XLPD and their relatives will be analyzed to determine the precise genetic defect associated with the disease. Blood samples or discarded tissues from other patients with EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and blood samples from normal individuals will be obtained to serve as controls. Knowledge gained from this study should provide important insights into the immunologic control of EBV lymphoproliferative disease associated with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. In addition, identification of the molecular mechanisms for these diseases may provide clues to other EBV-associated diseases including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease.","This study will study the effects of the gene on the X chromosome that is associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLPD)-an inherited disease affecting the immune system-on the function of the immune system. XLPD has been linked to an abnormality in a specific region of the X chromosome (one of 23 chromosome pairs that contain the genes that determine a person's hereditary makeup). The disease may develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV affects more than 95 percent of people in the United States. It usually does not cause any symptoms in children. In adolescents and adults, however, EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and sometimes lymphoproliferative disease, such as XLPD. In these diseases lymph tissues, such as lymph nodes, may become enlarged and immune function (infection-fighting ability) impaired. This study will compare DNA from patients with XLPD with that of their unaffected relatives, of patients with other lymphoproliferative diseases and of normal controls.

Patients of any age with XLPD, their unaffected relatives 18 years of age and older, and patients with other lymphoproliferative diseases may participate in this study.

Blood samples will be collected from all participants to study the effects of the gene on the X chromosome that appears to be abnormal in XLPD on the function of the immune system. In a 6-week period, no more than 100 milliliters (about 7 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn from adults and no more than 1 ml (1/6 teaspoon) of blood per pound of body weight from children. Blood from patients with XLPD and their relatives will also be tested for HLA type (similar to blood type testing) and the ability of HLA-matched cells from patients and relatives to interact will be examined.

If the participant has had a clinical genetic test performed, the results/data will be collected from the University of Kentucky (UK) clinical molecular pathology laboratory or from the medical records. If the cause of the disease is not identified on clinical genetic testing, the investigator will reanalyze the clinical genetic testing data or use the blood or saliva sample leftover from the clinical genetic testing for additional experiments using new methods to identify the cause of the disease.
If no sample leftover from the clinical genetic testing is available, the investigator plans to collect about 2 teaspoons of blood or saliva from the participant at their first visit to the site.

Recruiting,June 2015,,,Anticipated,1550,"Discovery of genetic basis of impaired metabolism has greatly advanced treatment of patients with known metabolic diseases. However, many more genetic and metabolic disorders and their molecular causes remain to be discovered. The overall goal of this study is to discover new disease-associated genes in children, while establishing a specific focus on metabolic disorders where molecular characterization is most likely to lead to novel therapies. The primary objective is to identify novel pathogenic mutations in children with rare Mendelian disorders. The secondary objectives are: 1) Optimize methodology for metabolomic sample collection, processing and analysis; and 2) Establish normative ranges for a large number (potentially up to 1000) of metabolites in healthy newborns and older children.

Approximately one in three admissions to tertiary care pediatric hospitals results from conditions with a genetic basis. Although the majority of these conditions are rare, they collectively account for a disproportionate amount of illness and death in children. Discovery of the genetic basis of rare conditions often uncovers the pathophysiological basis of common diseases. This is particularly true for genetic diseases of impaired metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism, IEMs). There are many more genetic and metabolic disorders yet to be discovered. Of approximately 20,000 known human genes, less than one-fifth are currently associated with a disease phenotype. IEMs are a particular area of focus for us for two major reasons. First, of the several hundred known IEMs, many are already effectively treated with dietary modifications and/or medical therapy. This indicates to us that discovery of new IEM genes has great potential to produce clinically actionable insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities, ultimately leading to treatment of children that would otherwise be impossible to treat. Second, the PI of this study, Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis, is an expert in metabolomics, the practice of identifying and quantifying metabolites from biological systems. We will therefore implement research-based metabolomic profiling to the evaluation of patients with suspected IEMs or other genetic diseases. This detailed analysis will substantially increase the likelihood of identifying clinically relevant metabolic perturbations in children with growth failure, acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and other abnormalities of putative genetic origin. It would also enable us to interpret mutations uncovered by clinical or research-based genomic sequencing. We believe that establishing a systematic procedure to evaluate both the metabolome and the genome in sick children will produce new insights into the genetic basis of pediatric disease, and ultimately new ways to treat these conditions.

In this study, subjects will be recruited as two populations: control and diseased. In the control population, plasma samples of healthy newborns will be acquired at the time of blood collection for state-mandated newborn screening from Parkland. We will also collect blood from healthy children from the clinics at Children's Medical Center (CMC), again piggybacking this research sample with venipuncture for clinically indicated blood collection. All plasma samples will be subjected to metabolomics to determine the healthy ranges for a large number of metabolites. This comprehensive profile of metabolites in children will be used as normative ranges to identify outlying metabolites in diseased subjects. Additionally, if suspected metabolic outliers are detected from this normal population, DNA samples extracted from the leftover packed cells or blood samples will be subjected to genomic sequencing to profile the associated gene mutations. The diseased population will be recruited from the clinics of the Pediatric Genetics and Metabolism Division in the Department of Pediatrics/CMC. Blood and DNA samples will be collected from patients for metabolomic analysis and next-generation sequencing respectively to define the metabolic abnormalities and associated gene mutations. Skin fibroblasts from patients will also be collected and used for biological validation of the metabolic effects of novel mutations, in particular by complementing diseased fibroblasts with wild-type alleles of genes mutated in the patient. If any rare Mendelian disorder is considered in a subject, blood from his/her family members will be acquired and subjected to metabolomic and genomic analyses to facilitate identification of the diseased-associated genes.","This is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded observational study. The overarching goal is to discover new disease-associated genes in children, while establishing a specific focus on disorders where molecular characterization is most likely to lead to novel therapies.

"Active, not recruiting","June 29, 2017",4 Months,,Anticipated,1000,"Acutely ill infant inpatients who have an undiagnosed illness, and their families, will be eligible to participate in the study. The investigators will enroll up to 1,000 infants. Locally, the study population will be recruited from Rady Children's Hospital (RCH) inpatient population, primarily the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), with a smaller population presenting to other hospital in-patient services. Recruitment will be targeted at the RCH main campus, but it may include referrals from satellite locations in the RCH network (particularly the RCH NICU network throughout San Diego County). All patients will continue to receive routine care as clinically indicated, including the state newborn screen and other genetic testing as determined by their treating providers. Half of the affected study participants will be randomized to receive rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the other half will receive rapid whole exome sequencing (WES). Each arm will initially be analyzed using the patient's (proband's) sample only. If a proband-only analysis fails to yield a diagnosis, genomic data from the biological family members (typically parents), when available, will be used to supplement analysis (trio analysis). Occasionally, a second affected sibling may be available for family analysis. Not infrequently, the father is not available for study. Similarly, the investigators anticipate the need for targeted genetic analysis of biological parents, and possibly other family members, to confirm diagnostic results and/or provide additional information regarding inheritance.

The investigators anticipate that in rare cases a newborn may be so ill that the team lacks equipoise that the child can wait for the estimated ten day turnaround time of our send-out exome testing. In these rare cases, the PI, or his delegate, will decide if the child is not eligible for randomization. These children will remain in the research study throughout the entirety of the study, but will receive in-house ultra-rapid whole genome sequencing by the RCIGM laboratory in lieu of either a rapid genome or rapid exome (both anticipated to be 10 day turn-arounds).

Enrollment will be sought within the first 96 hours following admission to RCH or an RCH network ICU or within 96 hours of meeting criteria for the study if the infant was not previously eligible. Patients and their family members who consent to participate will have their blood drawn and will be randomized to receive either rapid WGS or rapid WES. The initial symptom-driven analysis will be conducted on the patient's sample only (singleton analysis). If a diagnosis is not found promptly (within 24 hours) via a singleton analysis, the family (or any combination of parents and/or other family members) will be analyzed using the same technology that the patient was randomized to receive. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (as determined by ACMG guidelines) that relate in part or in whole to the patient's current phenotype will be clinically confirmed and reported into the patients' medical record. Although the intention of the study is to return symptom-driven results to the medical record, the clinical report for confirmation of symptom-driven findings may include negative findings of testing. In the event that our analysis incidentally finds a pathogenic variant for which a treatment or intervention exists to improve morbidity and/or mortality, families may choose not to receive this additional information.","This study will seek to determine if rapid genomic sequencing improves outcomes for acutely ill infants. The investigator will enroll up to 1,000 acutely ill infants in a prospective, randomized, blinded study to either rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or rapid Whole Exome Sequencing (WES, which is 2% of the genome and ~4-fold less expensive). Outcomes will be measured both by objective clinical measures and family perceptions (patient/family centered outcomes). Primary analysis of WGS or WES will be in infants alone. Secondary analysis, in infants who do not receive a diagnosis, will be of families - ideally trios (mother, father, and affected infant), which is ~2-fold more expensive. Trios will be analyzed within the same randomization arm (WGS or WES). This study is designed to quantify which acutely ill infants benefit from rapid genomic sequencing, by how much they benefit, how they benefit, which rapid genomic sequencing method is superior, and the cost effectiveness of such testing."

Examination of whether changes in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by FMRP (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment response. It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including Rasopathies.

The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for 10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within picture-book based story-telling episodes. Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted strategies in other everyday interactions with their child.

Analysis of copy number variations of genes on tumor deoxyribonucleic acid by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
Analysis of rearrangements involving the gene Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase that can't be detected by Next Generation Sequencing or array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (balanced translocations) by means of fluorescent hybridization probes on tumor samples Immunologic profile: analysis of the expression of relevant immunologic markers

Clinical data collection:

Patients' clinical data will be collected from the patient medical record. This study is not a treatment evaluation. Patients' follow-up and treatment will be performed according to the center local practices or to the specificities of a clinical trial in which the patient would have been enrolled, depending on the recommendations given by the multidisciplinary molecular board, with the review of the tumor genetic profile.","It is a non-randomized, multicentric, cohort study, combined with a biological sample collection, a clinical data collection and with a genetic and immunologic biomarkers study.

The ProfiLER program aims to implement a personalized cancer medicine approach by proposing to establish the genetic and immunologic profile of the tumor for patients with an advanced malignant tumor, in order to define a map of genetic (for the pre-identified target genes) and immunologic profiles for all the studied types of cancer. This study will also allow adapting the therapeutic management of these patients, if needed, by giving them targeted therapies or immunotherapies (commercialized on in ongoing clinical trials), based on the recommendations of the multidisciplinary molecular board.

The genetic and immunologic profile of the tumor will be determined from archival or fresh collected (biopsy of a reachable lesion) tumor sample and from a blood sample. The correlation between genetic profiles of the tumor, patients immunity status and clinical data (progression, tumor response, etc.) collected from the patient medical records will probably allow us to identify biomarkers with a potential predictive value and to determine if some genetic disorders are linked to immunity status alterations."
